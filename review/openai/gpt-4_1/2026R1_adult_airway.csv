clinical,Inconsistent Sedation Intervals,midazolam is to be dosed every 10 minutes under "Management of Adequate vs. Inadequate Airway" but every 5 minutes under "Sedation and Analgesia For Advanced Airway Placement"; intervals should be standardized or rationale explained.
clinical,Nasal Cannula at 15 LPM During Intubation,applying nasal cannula at 15 lpm during intubation attempts is not universally supported and may be unnecessary or inappropriate in all patients; recommend clarifying intent (e.g., apneic oxygenation) and referencing supporting literature or limiting to appropriate situations.
clinical,Sellick's Maneuver as Routine Assistance,sellick's maneuver (cricoid pressure) is no longer widely recommended due to insufficient evidence of benefit and possible harm; protocol should update or qualify this recommendation.
clinical,No Pediatric Consideration,there is no mention of pediatric airway considerations or modifications, which may lead to unsafe practice in children or infants.
clinical,No Mention of End-Tidal CO2 Colorimetric Devices,the protocol mandates "capnography" but does not specify what to do if waveform is unavailable; clarification may improve care in low-resource situations.
operational,Unclear Medical Control Criteria,protocol instructs to "consult medical control where indicated" but does not provide criteria for when consultation is required.
operational,BVM Placement Before Airway Adjunct Missing,bag-valve-mask should be emphasized prior to advanced airway if basic maneuvers are ineffective instead of in parallel with nasal/oral airway adjunct placement; current wording may lead to suboptimal sequence.
operational,Documentation Requirements Spread Out,documentation of failed intubation attempts is mentioned but documentation standards for other procedures (e.g. capnography, extraglottic devices) are not as clear; consider consolidating or referencing documentation protocols.
operational,Selective Airway Device Use Not Standardized,in some locations, only paramedics are instructed to "consider" an extraglottic airway if unable to intubate, but in others, the instruction seems more general; clarity may help teams function more cohesively.
operational,No Explicit Confirmation Steps For ETT,protocol lacks a step-by-step sequence for confirming tube placement by multiple methods after intubation attempt, which may result in unrecognized misplaced airway.
operational,No Mention of BLS Airway Escalation,protocol does not specify when to escalate from BLS maneuvers to advanced airway for basic providers, risking undue delays.
wording,"MANUVERS" Typo,"basic manuvers first" should be "basic maneuvers first".
wording,Complex Bullet Structure,some sections (particularly medication options) use complex nested bulleted/numbered lists that could be clearer, for example in sedation and analgesia the combination/sequence of drugs is not immediately apparent.
wording,AEMT Intubation Section Unclear,"AEMT: apneic or pulseless and apneic patient only" is awkwardly constructed and could confuse readers; clarify whether both apneic-only and pulseless/apneic patients are meant.
wording,ETT as Abbreviation Unintroduced,"consider c-collar to maintain ETT placement" uses ETT (endotracheal tube) without introducing or defining the abbreviation earlier in the document.
wording,Overuse of ALLCAPS,many terms (e.g., "UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL", "TRANSPORT", "APPROPRIATE") are in all-caps without clear distinction or consistent use, which can make scanning the protocol difficult.
wording,Unexplained Abbreviations,BIAD is defined in "Other Information" but not at first use; EMT, AEMT, and RSI are not explained in this document, which may interfere with comprehension for new or cross-trained staff.
wording,"Treat per specific protocol" Non-specific,the phrase "treat per specific protocol" is used but does not reference a protocol name, number, or location, which may cause delays or confusion.
