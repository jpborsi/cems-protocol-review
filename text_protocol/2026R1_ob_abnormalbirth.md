# Childbirth / Obstetrical Emergencies: Abnormal Birth Emergencies

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. Patient Assessment
3. Continue with further steps as necessary:
    1. Maintain airway and support ventilation as needed.
    2. Reassess mother’s vital signs continuously.
    3. Prevent hypothermia in newborn. After delivery, drying, and stimulation, place baby skin to skin with mother if newborn does not require resuscitation.
    4. A delivered child should get another PCR as a second patient.
    5. Transport to an appropriate facility with OB services if the patient is pregnant.
    6. CONTACT receiving facility.
    7. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated.
    8. APPROPRIATE transfer of care.

### Cord Around Neck
If, as the baby's head passes out the vaginal opening, a cord is felt or seen around the neck:

1. Loosen cord or clamp and cut if too tight.
2. Continue delivery.

### Prolapsed Cord
If the umbilical cord presents first or is seen/felt in the vagina:

1. Transport mother with hips elevated and knees to chest.
2. Cover cord with sterile saline dressing.
3. Insert fingers to relieve pressure on cord and elevate presenting part away from cord; distribute pressure evenly when occiput presents.
4. DO NOT attempt to push cord back.
5. High flow oxygen and transport IMMEDIATELY.

### Breech Birth
If a foot, feet, or buttocks present first, or if breech delivery is in process:

1. If single limb presenting, transport immediately.
2. Do not encourage mother to push.
3. Support but do not pull presenting parts.
4. If delivery is in process and the head is clamped inside vagina:
    * Create air passage by supporting body of infant and placing 2 gloved fingers, forming a “V”, to push vaginal canal away from face to facilitate an airway passage.
    * Maintain passage until child is delivered completely.
5. If unable to deliver, transport mother with hips elevated and knees to chest.

### Shoulder Dystocia
If following delivery of the head, the shoulder(s) become “stuck” behind the symphysis pubis or sacrum:

1. Place pressure above symphysis pubis.
2. Consider intervaginal rotation of stuck anterior shoulder towards baby’s chest (Rubins) or intravaginal posterior shoulder rotation (Woods Corkscrew) if trained.
3. Transport mother with hips elevated and knees to chest.

## Indications
* Abnormal birth presentation including:
    * Cord around neck
    * Prolapsed cord
    * Breech birth (frank breech, footling breech)
    * Shoulder dystocia
    * Transverse lie, face first presentation

## Signs and Symptoms
* Frank breech (buttocks presents first)
* Footling breech (one foot or both feet presenting)
* Transverse lie (fetus is on his / her side with possible arm or leg presenting)
* Face first presentation
* Prolapsed cord (umbilical cord presents first)

## Differential Diagnosis
* Miscarriage
* Stillbirth

## Key Points
* DO NOT pull on any presenting body parts.
* These patients will most likely require a c-section, so immediate transport is needed.
* Prolonged, non-progressive labor distresses the fetus and mother. Be sure to reassess mother’s vital signs continuously.
* Transport to an appropriate facility with OB services if the patient is pregnant.
* A delivered child should get another PCR as a second patient.
* After delivery, drying, and stimulation place baby on mother skin to skin to prevent hypothermia if the newborn does not require resuscitation. Prevent hypothermia in all cases.

* Cord Around Baby's Neck:
    * As baby's head passes out the vaginal opening, feel for the cord. Initially try to slip cord over baby’s head; if too tight, clamp cord in two places and cut between clamps.

* Breech Delivery:
    * Footling breech: one or both feet delivered first.
    * Frank breech: buttocks first presentation.
    * When feet or buttocks first become visible, there is normally time to transport patient to nearest facility.
    * If upper thighs or buttocks have come out of the vagina, delivery is imminent.
    * If child’s body has delivered and head appears caught in the vagina: EMT must support the child’s body and insert two fingers into the vagina along the child's neck until the chin is located. At this point, the two fingers should be placed between the chin and the vaginal canal and then advanced past mouth and nose.
    * After achieving this position, a passage for air must be created by pushing the vaginal canal away from the child's face. This air passage must be maintained until the child is completely delivered.

* Excessive Bleeding Pre-Delivery:
    * If bleeding is excessive during this time and delivery is imminent, in addition to normal delivery procedures, use the HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK PROTOCOL.
    * If delivery is not imminent, transport on her left side and shock protocol followed.

* Excessive Bleeding Post-Delivery:
    * If bleeding appears to be excessive, start IV of saline.
    * If placenta has been delivered, massage uterus and put baby to mother’s breast.
    * Follow HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK PROTOCOL.

* Prolapsed Cord:
    * When the umbilical cord passes through the vagina and is exposed, check cord for a pulse.
    * Transport with hips elevated or in the knee chest position and a moist dressing around cord.
    * If umbilical cord is seen or felt in the vagina, insert two fingers to elevate presenting part away from cord, distribute pressure evenly when occiput presents.
    * DO NOT attempt to push the cord back. High flow oxygen and transport IMMEDIATELY.

* Shoulder Dystocia:
    * Following delivery of the head the shoulder(s) become “stuck” behind the symphysis pubis or sacrum of the mother.
    * Occurs in approximately 1% of births.
