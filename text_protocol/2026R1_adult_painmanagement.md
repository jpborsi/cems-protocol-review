    1. **Contraindications:** Not for use in patients with altered mentation, traumatic abdominal pain, head trauma, or hypovolemia.
    2. If pain is not listed below, contact Online Medical Control.

### Pain Management for Listed Conditions
Criteria: 
Patient has one or more of the following:
- Burns
- Intractable flank pain
- Intractable back pain
- Musculoskeletal and/or fracture pain
- Sickle cell pain crisis (use supplemental O2)
- Unremitting abdominal pain (NOT OB)

Treatment options:

1. **Non-Narcotic Analgesic**
    - **Ketamine**: 10 mg IV/IO/IM/IN every 10 min as needed, 30 mg max. *Use 10 mg/ml concentration.*

2. **Narcotic Analgesics**
    - **HYDROmorphone**: 0.5–1 mg IV/IO/IM every 10 min as needed, 2 mg max
        - Preferred analgesic for extended duration/unremitting pain
        - Reduce dose if over 65, or with liver or kidney disease
        - If unavailable, see medication section for morphine sulfate
    - **FentaNYL**: 25–100 mcg IV/IO/IM/IN every 10 min as needed, 200 mcg max
        - Preferred analgesic for trauma/ACS
        - Push slow IV/IO
        - Reduce dose if over 65, or with liver or kidney disease
        - If unavailable, see medication section for morphine sulfate

3. **Anti-Inflammatory**
    - **Ketorolac**: 15 mg IV/IO (no repeat) or 30 mg IM (no repeat)
        - Avoid if over 65 or with kidney disease
        - Contraindicated with recent/suspected bleeding, allergy/hypersensitivity to NSAIDs, asthmatics with NSAID sensitivity, known/obvious pregnancy, or nursing mothers
        - Preferred for kidney stones/flank pain

4. **As needed:**
    - Consider nausea/vomiting protocol

### Pain Other Than Listed Protocol
- Contact Online Medical Control prior to administration

## Indications
* Burns
* Intractable flank pain
* Intractable back pain
* Musculoskeletal and/or fracture pain
* Sickle cell pain crisis (use supplemental O2)
* Unremitting abdominal pain (not OB)
* Other severe pain (with Medical Control consultation)

## Signs and Symptoms
* Severity (pain scale)
* Quality (sharp, dull, etc.)
* Radiation
* Relation to movement or respiration
* Increased with palpation of area

## Differential Diagnosis
* Musculoskeletal
* Visceral (abdominal)
* Cardiac
* Pleuritic (respiratory)
* Neurogenic
* Renal (colic)
* Per specific protocol

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental status, area of pain, neuro exam
* Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage.
* Pain is subjective (whatever the patient says it is).
* Pain severity (0-10) is a vital sign to be recorded pre-, post-medication delivery, and at disposition.
* Use analgesia for suspected cardiac chest pain within the ACS protocol.
* Abdominal pain patients must have a diagnostic EKG to rule out cardiac involvement.
* Vital signs should be obtained pre-, 10 minutes post-, and at disposition with all pain medications.
* Contraindications to HYDROmorphone or FentaNYL use include hypotension, head injury, respiratory distress, or severe COPD.
* All patients should have drug allergies documented prior to administering pain medications.
* All patients who receive pain medications must be observed 15 minutes for drug reaction.
* The patient’s vital signs must be routinely reassessed.
* Have Naloxone on hand if the patient has respiratory depression or hypotension after HYDROmorphone or FentaNYL administration. Be prepared to ventilate.
* DO NOT administer narcotic analgesics if there is any suspicion of a head injury.
* All patients who receive medication for pain must have continuous ECG monitoring, pulse oximetry.
* Capnography is required if patient already has narcotic analgesics on board prior to supplementation.
* Capnography is required if second doses of narcotic analgesics are required to control the patient’s pain.
* Consider asking patient history of opiate addiction – consider non-narcotic options.
* Ketamine use in pregnancy is a risk/benefit assessment per case. Consult Medical Control if there are questions.

## Other Information 

### Pain Assessment – History

- Age/onset
- Location
- Duration
- Severity (0–10)
- Past medical history
- Medications
- Drug allergies

### Pain Scales

#### The Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale
Designed for children aged 3 years and older, also helpful for elderly or cognitively impaired. Offers a visual description for those who don't have the verbal skills to explain how their symptoms make them feel.

#### A Numerical Pain Scale
A numerical pain scale allows you to describe the intensity of your discomfort in numbers ranging from 0 to 10. Numerical pain scales may include words or descriptions to better label your symptoms, from feeling no pain to experiencing excruciating pain.

*Some researchers believe this type of combination scale may be most sensitive to gender and ethnic differences in describing pain.*
