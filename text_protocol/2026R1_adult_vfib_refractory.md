# Refractory Ventricular Fibrillation / Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia

## Overall Procedure
1. Reassess and assure that all previous interventions are functioning as expected:
    1. Oxygen supply to BVM still appropriate
    2. Airway properly in place with a capnography waveform
    3. CPR is optimized / Device in proper position
    4. Defib Pads properly adhered and positioned
2. Consider Transport and / or Medical Direction Contact
3. Continue with further steps as necessary.

### Refractory or V-FIB / V-TACH
Criteria: Patient stays in V-FIB / V-TACH after exhausting the V-FIB / V-TACH algorithm.

1. Consider Treatable Causes:
    1. Hypovolemia
    2. Hypo-hyperkalemia
    3. Hypoxia
    4. Hypoglycemia
    5. Hydrogen ion (acidosis)
    6. Hypothermia
    7. Toxins
    8. Tamponade (cardiac)
    9. Tension pneumothorax
    10. Thrombosis (coronary or pulmonary)
    11. Trauma
2. CONSIDER ELECTRICAL VECTOR CHANGE:
    1. Add Anterior / Posterior Pads
    2. Attempt Defibrillation
3. If capable, after minimum of 4 unsuccessful EMS defibrillations, CONSIDER DOUBLE SEQUENTIAL DEFIBRILLATION
4. Magnesium Sulfate 2 grams over 1-2 minutes IV/IO (may repeat 2 gram dose prn up to max 6 grams)
5. Consider OTHER anti-arrhythmics NOT given during arrest:
    1. Lidocaine 1-1.5 mg/kg IV/IO First Dose; 0.5–0.75 mg/kg IV/IO Second Dose if needed (max dose 3 mg/kg)
    2. OR Continue Epinephrine 1 mg IV/IO of 0.1 mg/ml q 3-5 minutes
    3. OR Amiodarone 300 mg IV/IO (may repeat @ 150 mg IV/IO in 3-5 minutes – max 450 mg)
6. Consider Field Termination of Resuscitative Efforts
7. Transport to appropriate facility
8. Contact receiving facility
9. Consult Medical Control where indicated
10. Appropriate transfer of care

### Recurrent V-FIB / V-TACH
Criteria: Patient goes back into V-FIB / V-TACH after a conversion to another rhythm from EMS interventions.

1. Defibrillate at the previous setting used.
2. Continue with steps as in "Refractory or V-FIB / V-TACH".

## Indications
* Unresponsive, apneic, pulseless patient
* Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia on ECG

## Signs and Symptoms
* Estimated down time
* Past medical history
* Medications
* Events leading to arrest
* Renal failure / dialysis
* DNR

## Differential Diagnosis
* Asystole
* Artifact / device failure
* Cardiac
* Endocrine / metabolic
* Drugs
* Pulmonary embolus

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status
* Always minimize interruptions to chest compressions.
* When IV access failed or difficult, humeral head IO are preferred routes over tibial IO for resuscitation.
* Effective CPR should be as continuous as possible with a minimum of 5 cycles or 2 minutes.
* Reassess and document endotracheal tube placement and Capnography frequently, after every move, and at discharge.
* Polymorphic V-Tach (Torsades de Pointes) may benefit from administration of Magnesium Sulfate.
* If the patient converts to another rhythm, or has a return of circulation, refer to the appropriate protocol and treat accordingly.
* If the patient converts back to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia after being converted to ANY other rhythm, defibrillate at the previous setting used.
* Defibrillation following effective CPR is the definitive therapy for ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia.
* Magnesium Sulfate should be administered early in the arrest if hypomagnesemia (chronic alcoholic or malnourished patients) is suspected.
* If patient is pregnant and in cardiac arrest, manually manipulate the uterus to the left during CPR.
* Zoll and Phillips equivalency settings are 120,150,200 Joules to Physio Control / Stryker 200,300,360 Joules. If unsure about settings use highest joule setting per AHA.
* Damage to defibrillators during double sequential defibrillation may not be covered by manufacturers, use the technique with prior approval from your department.
* Do not delay transport or make stops to obtain a second defibrillator to accomplish double sequential defibrillation. This is only for situations where two are already on scene. The defibrillators do not have to be of the same make / model.
* Dextrose should only be administered to a patient with a confirmed blood glucose level less than 70 mg/dl.
* Strongly encourage transport of resuscitated patient to facility with PCI where available.
