# AIRWAY

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. Assess ABC’s Respiratory Rate, Effort, and Adequacy
3. Consider Supplemental OXYGEN
    1. COPD Patients: Treat per specific protocol
4. BASIC MANUVERS FIRST
    1. Open airway
    2. Nasal / Oral Airway
    3. Bag-Valve-Mask
5. Continue with further steps as necessary:
    1. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
    2. CONTACT receiving facility
    3. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
    4. APPROPRIATE transfer of care

### Management of Adequate vs. Inadequate Airway
* If Adequate: 
    1. Continue monitoring and supportive care.
* If Inadequate, Not Protecting / Anticipated Loss, or Obstructed Airway:
    1. Apply nasal cannula 15 LPM during intubation attempts.
    2. Additional Sedation Required After Advanced Airway Placement – Consider:
        - KETAMINE 1 mg/kg IV/IO 
        - OR MIDAZOLAM 2.5 mg IV/IO or 5 mg IM/IN – q 10 min prn – Max 10 mg
        - OR LORazepam 1–2 mg IV/IO/IM/IN – q 10 min prn – Max 4 mg
        - If Midazolam or LORazepam Unavailable, See Medication Section for DiazePAM
    3. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE Required

### Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) and Obstructed Airway
* SEE FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION PROTOCOL (FBAO Maneuvers)
* Direct Laryngoscopy
    1. Attempt Removal with Magill Forceps

### Intubation Procedure
* INTUBATION PROCEDURE
    1. Max 2 Intubation Attempts
    2. AEMT: Apneic or Pulseless and Apneic Patient Only
    3. Document Failed Attempt(s)
    4. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE Required
* If Unable to Intubate:
    1. Extraglottic (BIAD) AIRWAY Device
        - EMT Use in Pulseless & Apneic Patient Only
        - No Medications Down Extraglottic (BIAD) Airway
        - Esophageal Disease Contraindication
    2. Paramedics should consider using an extraglottic (BIAD) airway if unable to intubate.
    3. Consider the use of intubation aids such as a bougie or video laryngoscope to facilitate intubation.
* Consider RSI Protocol (APPROVED DEPARTMENTS ONLY)

### Sedation and Analgesia For Advanced Airway Placement
* Consider Sedation Prior To Advanced Airway Placement IF PATIENT RESPONDS TO PAIN:
    1. KETAMINE 1 mg/kg IV/IO – Usual Dose 100 mg, q 2 min prn – Max 200 mg
    2. OR MIDAZOLAM 2.5 mg IV/IO or 5 mg IM/IN – q 5 min prn – Max 10 mg
    3. OR LORazepam 1–2 mg IV/IO/IM/IN – q 10 min prn – Max 4 mg
        - If Midazolam or LORazepam Unavailable, See Medication Section for DiazePAM
    4. AND fentaNYL 25 mcg doses until pain tolerance prn q2 mins – Max 200 mcg

### Cricothyrotomy
* CRICOTHYROTOMY – NEEDLE, KIT, or SURGICAL (As provided and trained)
    1. Must Have Prior Medical Control Training / Approval
    2. Treat per specific protocol
    3. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE Required

### Management of Esophageal Obstruction
* Differentiate airway obstruction from esophageal obstruction.
* If esophageal obstruction, place patient in position of comfort, suction as needed and treat pain.

## Indications
* Apnea
* Coughing
* Choking
* Inability to speak
* Unresponsive
* Burns
* Trauma
* Witnessed aspiration

## Signs and Symptoms
* Sudden episode of choking
* Gagging
* Audible stridor
* Change in skin color
* Decreased LOC
* Increased or decreased Respiratory rate
* Labored breathing
* Unproductive cough

## Differential Diagnosis
* Cardiac arrest
* Respiratory arrest
* Anaphylaxis
* Esophageal obstruction

## Key Points
* EMT may only place extraglottic (BIAD) airways in pulseless and apneic patients.
* Advanced EMT’s may perform orotracheal intubation or place an extraglottic (BIAD) airway on apneic or apneic and pulseless patients.
* Capnography is mandatory with all methods of intubation. Document results.
* Maintain C-spine immobilization for patients with suspected spinal injury.
* Do not assume hyperventilation is psychogenic - use oxygen, not a paper bag.
* Sellick's maneuver should be used to assist with difficult intubations.
* Paramedics should consider using an extraglottic (BIAD) airway if they are unable to Intubate.
* Consider c-collar to maintain ETT placement for all intubated patients to maintain tube.
* Consider the use of intubation aids such as a bougie or video laryngoscope to facilitate intubation.
* Ketamine use in pregnancy is a risk / benefit assessment per case. Consult Medical Control if there are questions.
* Ketamine is the preferred induction agent with asthmatic patients.

## Other Information
* Extraglottic airway device / BIAD (Blind Insertion Airway Device) Examples (not limited to); iGel, King Airway, LMA, Etc.
