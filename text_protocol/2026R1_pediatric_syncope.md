# Pediatric Protocol: Syncope / Near Syncope

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Patient Assessment
    1. Take cardiac monitor to patient’s side.
    2. Apply cardiac monitor ASAP once on scene.
    3. Maintain monitoring throughout transport including into hospital bed.
3. Continue with further steps as necessary
    1. Consider Spinal Motion Restriction
    2. Airway / Breathing
        - Airway Protocol
        - Oxygen / Pulse Oximetry Procedure
        - Capnography Procedure
        - Blood Glucose Procedure
        - IV Procedure
    3. Diagnostic EKG Procedure
        - 1st Contact to EKG and Transmission < 10 min
    4. Identify Treatable Causes – Treat Per Specific Protocol
        - Hypoxia – Treat per Airway / Breathing Protocols
        - Stroke CVA / TIA – Treat per Stroke Protocol
        - Overdose – Treat per Toxic Ingestion Protocol
        - Hypo / Hyperglycemia – Treat per Diabetic Protocol
        - Head Trauma – Treat per Head Trauma Protocol
        - Arrhythmia – Treat per Correct Arrhythmia Protocol
        - Psychiatric – Treat per Behavioral Emergencies
        - Sepsis – Treat per Septic Shock Protocol
        - Hypo / Hyperthermia – Treat per Specific Protocol
        - Hypotension – Treat per Specific Shock Protocols
        - Anaphylaxis / Allergic Reaction
        - Seizure – Treat per Seizure Protocol
    5. Circulation / Shock Medical Trauma
    6. Transport to appropriate facility, contact receiving facility, consult Medical Control where indicated, appropriate transfer of care.

### EKG Pattern Recognition
Describe the criteria for high-risk EKG features:
- **Brugada EKG Pattern (High Risk Cardiac Death)**
    1. Type I: J wave amplitude ≥ 2mm, T wave negative, coved type ST-T configuration, gradually descending ST segment (terminal portion)
    2. Type II: J wave amplitude ≥ 2mm, T wave positive or biphasic, saddleback ST-T configuration, elevated ST segment
    3. Type III: J wave amplitude ≥ 2mm, T wave positive, saddleback ST-T configuration, elevated ST segment (≥ 1mm)
- **S1Q3T3 EKG Pattern (High Risk for PE)**
    1. Lead I: Large S Wave present
    2. Lead III: Q Wave present
    3. Lead III: T Wave inverted

## Indications
* Syncope or Near Syncope in patients of ANY AGE indicates a temporary lack of perfusion to the brain.

## Signs and Symptoms
* Loss of consciousness / near loss of consciousness
* Dizziness / lightheadedness
* Palpitations
* Bradycardia / tachycardia
* Irregular pulse
* Hypo / hyperglycemia
* Hypotension
* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
* Pale
* Neuro deficits
* S1Q3T3 EKG pattern
* Brugada Syndrome EKG patterns

## Differential Diagnosis
* Vasovagal (BM, urination, coughing, GI stimulation)
* Cardiac (arrhythmia, MI, valve disorders)
* Drug / medication induced
* Orthostatic Hypotension
* Pulmonary embolism
* Hypoglycemia
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Dehydration
* Hypovolemia
* Stroke / TIA
* Anaphylaxis
* Seizure
* Autonomic failure (MS, Parkinson’s, DM, age, spinal cord injuries)
* Cardiac tamponade
* Aortic dissection
* Toxicological

## Key Points
* Required Exam: Mental Status, Skin, HEENT, Neck, Heart, Lung, Abdomen, Back, Extremities, Neuro
* Do not write off marginal vitals or findings as “normal”. These cases need to be evaluated in depth.
* History of preceding events is crucial to understanding cause. Determine onset, duration, LOC, patient recall of events, speed of recovery, neuro presentations, incontinence.
* Consider family history.
* Consider myocarditis if current or recent viral illness.
* Consider ectopic pregnancy if pregnancy known or suspected.
* CHF are extremely high-risk cases due to potential for arrhythmia.
* Pay attention to diagnostic EKG intervals, U waves, ectopic beats.
* Near syncope does not mean less risk.
* Syncope / near syncope patients should be transported even with identified and EMS treatable causes.

## Other Information

- Syncope or Near Syncope in patients of ANY AGE indicates a temporary lack of perfusion to the brain. EMS should have a high index of suspicion and encourage transport for complete assessment despite patient return to baseline. Risk for future complications or death is high in many patients based on cause. Syncope may have many causes, evaluate the patient completely and diligently.
