# RESPIRATORY DISTRESS UPPER AIRWAY - CROUP

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. Calm Patient
3. Position Patient in Position of Comfort
    1. Do not lay patient down
    2. Do not perform digital airway exam
4. PULSE OXIMETERY PROCEDURE – Administer O2
5. Patient Assessment
6. Continue with further steps as necessary
    1. IF WHEEZING GO TO RESPIRATORY DISTRESS LOWER AIRWAY PROTOCOL
    2. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
    3. CONTACT receiving facility
    4. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
    5. APPROPRIATE transfer of care

### Mild Distress Procedure
1. Nebulized Normal Saline throughout transport

### Moderate / Severe Distress (Stridor at Rest) Procedure
1. RACEMIC EPINEPHRINE: Unit Dose (2.25% 0.5ml) mixed in 3ml of Normal Saline, Nebulized – No Repeat  
    - NOT for Foreign Body Airway Obstructions
    - If Racemic Epinephrine is unavailable, see medication section for aerosol Epinephrine 1mg/ml
2. methylPREDNISolone: 2 mg/kg – IV/IO/IM, No Repeat - Max dose 125 mg

## Indications
* Pediatric patient with respiratory distress and suspected upper airway involvement (croup).

## Signs and Symptoms
* Anxious appearance
* Barking cough
* Stridor
* Gagging
* Drooling
* Inability to swallow
* Increased respiratory effort

## Differential Diagnosis
* Asthma
* Aspiration
* Foreign body
* Infection
* Pneumonia
* Epiglottitis
* Congenital heart disease
* Medication or toxin
* Trauma

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, HEENT, Skin, Neck, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremities, Neuro
* CONSIDER FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION
* Do not force a child into a position. They will protect their airway by their body position.
* The most important component of respiratory distress is airway control.
* Croup typically affects children < 2 years of age. It is viral, possible fever, gradual onset, no drooling is noted.
* Epiglottitis is rare and typically affects children > 2 years of age. Patients will appear very sick. It is bacterial, with fever, rapid onset, possible stridor, patient wants to sit up to keep airway open, and drooling is common. Airway manipulation may worsen the condition. DO NOT attempt invasive procedures on the conscious patient who is suspected to have epiglottis.
* DO NOT attempt an invasive airway procedure unless the patient is in respiratory arrest.
* Tracheitis presents in a similar manner to epiglottitis and the patient will also appear very sick.
* Stridor, gagging or choking in the breathing patient with respiratory distress may indicate upper airway obstruction.
* Wheezing in the breathing patient with respiratory distress indicates lower airway disease, which may come from a variety of causes. The patient with severe lower airway disease may have altered LOC, be unable to talk, may have absent or markedly decreased breath sounds and severe retractions with accessory muscle use.
* If the patient has signs of respiratory failure, begin to assist ventilations with BVM, even when they are breathing.

## Other Information
* These patients present with “Seal Bark Cough” or Stridor. If Patient is wheezing, it is a lower airway etiology and should be treated by the Respiratory Distress Lower Airway Protocol.
* HISTORY:
    * Time of onset
    * Possibility of foreign body
    * Medical history
    * Medications
    * Fever or respiratory infection
    * Other sick siblings
    * History of trauma
* Pediatric weight chart included for medication dosing reference.
