# Pediatric Protocol: Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO)

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Patient Assessment
3. If foreign body aspiration is witnessed or very strongly suspected and there is complete airway obstruction, continue with further steps as necessary.
    1. Never perform blind finger sweeps in infants or children.
    2. Attempt to clear the airway only if complete airway obstruction.
    3. Even with a complete airway obstruction, positive-pressure ventilation is often successful.

### Infant (0–12 months) Procedure

**Criteria:** Infant age 0–12 months.

#### If Coughing and Conscious
1. Encourage patient to cough.
2. Transport to appropriate facility.
3. Contact receiving facility.
4. Consult Medical Control where indicated.
5. Appropriate transfer of care.

#### If Complete Obstruction and Conscious
1. Deliver 5 back blows / 5 chest thrusts.
2. If becomes unconscious, proceed to “Complete Obstruction, Unconscious” path.

#### If Complete Obstruction and Unconscious
1. Head Tilt / Chin Lift / Jaw Thrust / Airway Maneuvers.
2. Oxygen 10–15 L Infant Mask as tolerated.
3. Visualize and consider finger sweep only if foreign body is visualized/attainable.
4. Consider use of laryngoscope / Magill forceps.
5. Open airway / ventilate (may reposition and repeat).
6. If unable to ventilate, repeat/continue sequence.
7. If still unable to ventilate, begin chest compressions / CPR.
8. Return to open airway, ventilate, repeat as above.

### Child (1–8 years) Procedure

**Criteria:** Child age 1–8 years.

#### If Coughing and Conscious
1. Encourage patient to cough.
2. Transport to appropriate facility.
3. Contact receiving facility.
4. Consult Medical Control where indicated.
5. Appropriate transfer of care.

#### If Complete Obstruction and Conscious
1. Deliver abdominal thrusts.
2. If becomes unconscious, proceed to “Complete Obstruction, Unconscious” path.

#### If Complete Obstruction and Unconscious
1. Head Tilt / Chin Lift / Jaw Thrust / Airway Maneuvers.
2. Oxygen 10–15 LPM Pediatric Mask as tolerated.
3. Visualize and consider finger sweep only if foreign body is visualized/attainable.
4. Consider use of laryngoscope / Magill forceps.
5. Open airway / ventilate (may reposition and repeat).
6. If unable to ventilate, repeat/continue sequence.
7. If still unable to ventilate, begin chest compressions / CPR.
8. Return to open airway, ventilate, repeat as above.

## Indications
* Coughing
* Choking
* Inability to speak
* Unresponsive
* Witnessed aspiration

## Signs and Symptoms
* Sudden episode of choking
* Audible stridor
* Change in skin color
* Decreased level of consciousness (LOC)
* Increased / decreased respiratory rate
* Labored breathing
* Unproductive cough
* Cardiac arrest
* Respiratory arrest

## Differential Diagnosis
* Cardiac arrest
* Respiratory arrest
* Anaphylaxis

## Key Points
* Infants 0–12 months DO NOT receive abdominal thrusts. Use chest thrusts.
* NEVER perform blind finger sweeps in infants or children.
* Attempt to clear the airway should only be made if foreign body aspiration is witnessed or very strongly suspected and there is complete airway obstruction.
* Even with a complete airway obstruction, positive-pressure ventilation is often successful.
