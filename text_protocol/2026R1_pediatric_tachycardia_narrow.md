# NARROW – COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA (Pediatric Protocol)

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. Cardiac Monitor
3. Attempt to Identify Cause
4. IV / IO PROCEDURE
5. Continue with further steps as necessary:
    1. May attempt Vagal Maneuvers (May go directly to Cardioversion if needed)
    2. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE

### Management – Stable (Signs of Perfusion)
- Criteria: HR > 220 infant / HR > 180 child, patient stable (signs of perfusion).
1. If vascular access already in place: 
    - Administer ADENOSINE 0.1 mg/kg IV/IO Rapid – Followed with flush (Max dose 6 mg, use upper extremity venous access).
2. If no response within 1–2 minutes:
    - Administer ADENOSINE 0.2 mg/kg IV Rapid – Followed with flush (Max dose 12 mg – No repeat).
3. IV Normal Saline Bolus 10–20 ml/kg if signs of dehydration or hypoperfusion. Repeat as needed.
4. If rhythm changes, go to appropriate protocol.

### Management – Unstable (Signs of Hypoperfusion)
- Criteria: HR > 220 infant / HR > 180 child, patient unstable (signs of hypoperfusion).
1. SYNCHRONIZED CARDIOVERSION (0.5–1 J/kg). Consider sedation:
    - MIDAZOLAM 0.05–0.1 mg/kg IV/IO q 5 min prn – Max dose 2.5 mg
    - MIDAZOLAM 0.2 mg/kg IM/IN q 5 min prn – Max dose 5 mg
    - OR LORazepam 0.05 mg/kg slow IV/IO/IN q 10 min prn – Max dose 2 mg
2. If no response within 1–2 minutes:
    - Repeat SYNCHRONIZED CARDIOVERSION as needed (1–2 J/kg)
3. IV Normal Saline Bolus 10–20 ml/kg if signs of dehydration or hypoperfusion. Repeat as needed.
4. If rhythm changes, go to appropriate protocol.

### Post-Treatment / Final Management
1. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
2. CONTACT receiving facility
3. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
4. APPROPRIATE transfer of care

## Indications
* Pediatric patient with narrow-complex tachycardia
* HR > 220 bpm (infant) / HR > 180 bpm (child)

## Signs and Symptoms
* Respiratory distress
* Syncope or near syncope
* HR: Child > 180 bpm / Infant > 220 bpm
* Pale or cyanosis
* Diaphoresis
* Tachypnea
* Vomiting
* Hypotension
* Altered level of consciousness
* Pulmonary congestion
* Syncope

## Differential Diagnosis
* Heart disease (congenital)
* Hypo / hyperthermia
* Hypovolemia or anemia
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Anxiety / pain / emotional stress
* Fever / infection / sepsis
* Hypoxia
* Hypoglycemia
* Medication / toxin / drugs (see HX)
* Pulmonary embolus
* Trauma
* Tension pneumothorax

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Skin, Neck, Lung, Heart, Abdomen, Back, Extremities, Neuro
* Carefully evaluate the rhythm to distinguish Sinus Tachycardia, Supraventricular Tachycardia, and Ventricular Tachycardia
* Separating the child from the caregiver may worsen the child's clinical condition.
* Pediatric pads should be used in children < 10 kg.
* Monitor for respiratory depression and hypotension associated if LORazepam or midazOLAM is used.
* Continuous pulse oximetry is required for all SVT Patients if available.
* Document all rhythm changes with monitor strips and obtain monitor strips with each therapeutic intervention.
* Possible causes of tachycardia: hypoxia, hypovolemia, fear, fever, and pain.
* A complete medical history must be obtained.
* Do not delay cardioversion to gain vascular access for the unstable patient.
* If you are unable to get the monitor to select a low enough joule setting, contact Online Medical Control.
* If the patient is stable, do not cardiovert.
* Record 3-Lead EKG strips during adenosine administration.
* Perform a diagnostic EKG prior to and after Adenosine conversion or cardioversion of SVT.
* If the rhythm changes, follow the appropriate protocol.

## Other Information
* Past medical history
* Medications or toxic ingestion (Aminophylline, diet pills, thyroid supplements, decongestants, digoxin)
* Drugs (nicotine, cocaine)
* Congenital heart disease
* Fluid Resuscitate to systolic of 70 + 2 x age
* If Midazolam or LORazepam Unavailable, see Medication Section for Diazepam
* I Capnography Required
* Document all rhythm changes with monitor strips and obtain monitor strips with each therapeutic intervention.
* Perform a diagnostic EKG prior to and after Adenosine conversion or cardioversion of SVT.
