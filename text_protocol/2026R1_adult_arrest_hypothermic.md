# Hypothermic Cardiac Arrest

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Attach Cardiac Monitor
3. Defibrillator / AED as soon as available
4. Patient Assessment
    1. If rectal temp is < 30 degrees C (86 degrees F), begin CPR immediately.
    2. If patient rectal temp is > 30 degrees C (86 degrees F), follow STANDARD CARDIAC ARREST PROTOCOLS.
    3. If temperature is unable to be measured, treat the patient based on the suspected temperature.
    4. Consider transport direct to a center capable of emergent ECMO; better to transport to a center that can do emergent ECMO even if it is much further away.
    5. All ECPR centers can place patients on ECMO for hypothermia, but some non-ECPR centers can also. Call medical control to discuss.
5. Continue with further steps as necessary

### Criteria for Death / DNR / Withhold Resuscitation
Describe the criteria for selecting between multiple paths:
- Review DNR Comfort Care Guidelines
- Refer to DOA Guidelines
- Criteria for DNR
- Criteria for Death

1. Identify known dialysis patients in asystole, V-Fib, or pulseless V-Tach
2. Contact Online Medical Control if needed

### Treatment When Cardiac Arrest Due to Hypothermia Suspected

1. Begin CPR immediately if rectal temperature < 30 degrees C (86 degrees F)
2. Deliver Shock x1 if shockable (Limit to a single attempt until warmed; use highest available Joule setting)
3. Ventilate at HALF standard rate (5 breaths/min)
4. IV / IO Procedure
5. Warm during arrest:
    - Remove wet clothing if applicable, dry and cover patient
    - Move to warmed area, increase ambient heat
    - Apply heat packs to groin, axilla, and neck (do not place packs directly against skin)
    - Consider warmed IV fluids if available
6. Withhold cardioactive medications until temp > 30 degrees C (86 degrees F)
7. May give dextrose products

### Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC)

1. Continue warming
2. Go to POST RESUSCITATION CARDIAC CARE PROTOCOL

### Transport Considerations

1. Transport to appropriate facility
2. CONTACT receiving facility
3. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
4. APPROPRIATE transfer of care

## Indications
* Patient is believed to be in cardiac arrest DUE TO hypothermia.

## Signs and Symptoms
* Unresponsive
* Apneic
* Pulseless

## Differential Diagnosis
* Medical vs. trauma
* V-Fib vs. pulseless V-Tach
* Asystole
* Pulseless electrical activity (PEA)

## Key Points
* If the temperature is unable to be measured, treat the patient based on the suspected temperature.
* Hypothermia may produce severe bradycardia.
* Shivering stops below 90° F (32° C).
* Hot packs can be activated and placed in the armpit and groin area if available.
* Care should be taken not to place the packs directly against the patient's skin.
* Consider withholding CPR if patient has organized rhythm. Discuss with Online Medical Control.
* Patients with low core temperatures may not respond to ALS drug interventions. Discuss ACLS drug use with Online Medical Control in severely hypothermic patients.
* Maintain warming procedure and supportive care. Warming procedures includes removing wet clothing, limiting exposure, and covering the patient with warm blankets if available.
* The most common mechanism of death in hypothermia is ventricular fibrillation. If the hypothermia victim is in ventricular fibrillation, CPR should be initiated. If V-FIB is not present, then all treatment and transport decisions should be tempered by the fact that V-FIB can be caused by rough handling, noxious stimuli, or even minor mechanical disturbances, this means that respiratory support with 100% oxygen should be done gently, including intubation, avoiding hyperventilation.
* The heart is most likely to fibrillate between 85 - 88° F (29 - 31° C.) Defibrillate VF / VT x1 if no change, perform CPR and defer repeat defibrillation attempts until patient has been rewarmed.

* Events leading to arrest
* Estimated downtime
* Past medical history
* Medications
* Existence of terminal illness
* Signs of lividity, rigor mortis
