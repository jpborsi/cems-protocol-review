# Uncomplicated Delivery

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Observed Head Crowning
3. Prepare Patient for Delivery
4. Set-Up Equipment
5. Contact Receiving Facility to Notify of Delivery
6. IV Procedure (if time, Not in AC)
    1. Normal Saline at KVO
7. Delivery of Head
    1. Firm, gentle pressure with flat of hand to slow expulsion
    2. Allow head to rotate normally
    3. Check for cord around neck
    4. Wipe face free of debris
    5. Suction mouth and nose with bulb syringe
8. Delivery of Body
    1. Place one palm over each ear with next contraction, gently move downward until upper shoulder appears
    2. Lift gently to ease out lower shoulder
    3. Support the head and neck with one hand and buttocks with other
9. Newborn and Cord

    2. Keep warm and dry
    3. After 10 seconds, clamp cord in two places with sterile equipment at least 6-8” from newborn
    4. Cut between clamps
    5. Allow placenta to deliver itself but do not delay transport while waiting
    6. Take placenta to hospital with patient
    7. DO NOT PULL ON CORD TO DELIVER PLACENTA!
    8. Perform APGAR Score at 1 min and 5 min post delivery
    9. Place baby on mother skin to skin for warmth unless resuscitation required – prevent hypothermia in all cases
10. Transport to appropriate facility
    1. Transport to hospital with OB facilities
    2. If < 35 weeks or unknown gestational age, transport to sub-specialty OB hospital
11. Contact receiving facility
12. Consult Medical Control where indicated

### Oxytocin Administration
Criteria: After delivery, for all deliveries regardless of bleeding. Do not give between multiple births. Wait until placental delivery unless hemorrhage, treat per OB Emergencies.

1. Oxytocin 10 Units IM
    1. No Repeat

## Indications
* Imminent delivery/normal childbirth

## Signs and Symptoms
* Spasmodic pain
* Vaginal discharge or bleeding
* Crowning or urge to push
* Meconium

## Differential Diagnosis
* Abnormal presentation
* Buttock
* Foot
* Hand
* Prolapsed cord
* Placenta previa
* Abruptio placenta

## Key Points
* Exam (of Mother): Mental Status, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Neuro
* Document all times (delivery, contraction frequency, and length).
* If maternal seizures occur, refer to the OBSTETRICAL EMERGENCIES PROTOCOL.
* After delivery, massaging the uterus (lower abdomen) will promote uterine contraction and help to control post-partum bleeding.
* Some bleeding is normal with any childbirth. Large quantities of blood or free bleeding are abnormal.
* Prepare to deliver on scene (protecting the patient’s privacy). If delivery becomes imminent while enroute, stop the squad and prepare for delivery.
* Newborns are very slippery, so be careful not to drop the baby.
* There is no need to wait on scene to deliver the placenta.
* If possible, transport between deliveries if the mother is expecting twins.
* Allow the placenta to deliver, but DO NOT delay transport while waiting.
* DO NOT PULL ON THE UMBILICAL CORD WHILE PLACENTA IS DELIVERING.
* A delivered child should get another PCR as a second patient
* After delivery, drying, and stimulation place baby on mother skin to skin to prevent hypothermia if the newborn does not require resuscitation. Prevent hypothermia in all cases.
* Transport to a hospital with OB services
* If < 35 weeks or unknown gestational age, transport to sub-specialty OB hospital.
