# Shock Guidelines

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Patient Assessment
3. Continue with further steps as necessary
    1. Perform orthostatic vital signs in non-trauma patients if suspected blood or fluid loss.
    2. Consider all possible causes of shock and treat per appropriate protocol.

### Anaphylactic Reaction / Shock
**Branch criteria:** Determine severity by airway involvement, circulatory compromise, and number of body systems involved.

#### Mild
- Rash, itching, no difficulty breathing or throat tightening, B/P – normal limits

    1. Apply Cardiac Monitor and Assess Vitals
    2. Administer diphenhydrAMINE 50 mg IV/IO/IM – No Repeat
    3. Consider EPINEPHrine 1 mg/ml (0.3–0.5 mg IM or Auto-Injector) if history of severe reaction or ≥2 body systems involved, q 10 min prn
        - Never given IV
        - EMT may draw and administer IM only with proper training

#### Moderate / Severe
- Rash, itching, airway compromise, wheezing, swelling, GI symptoms, hypotension, weak, thready or no radial pulses

    1. Secure Airway and Ventilate as needed
    2. OXYGEN
    3. Apply Cardiac Monitor and Assess Vitals
    4. Administer diphenhydrAMINE 50 mg IV/IO/IM – No Repeat
    5. Administer methylPREDISolone 125 mg IV/IO/IM – No Repeat
    6. Administer EPINEPHrine 1 mg/ml (0.3–0.5 mg IM or Auto-Injector) q 5 min prn
        - Never given IV
        - EMT may draw and administer IM only with proper training
    7. IV NORMAL SALINE BOLUS 20 ml/kg to maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 or radial pulses
    8. ALBUTEROL/IPRATROPIUM aerosol as indicated (EMT use only with online medical control)
    9. Consider ITD procedure
    10. Transport to appropriate facility; contact and consult with receiving facility/medical control

#### Impending Arrest
- Severe hypotension, any age, decreased LOC, airway compromise, weak, thready or no radial pulses

    1. Follow ACLS
    2. OXYGEN
    3. Secure Airway and Ventilate
    4. Administer EPINEPHrine 0.1 mg/ml (100 mcg/ml) IV/IO (100 mcg [1 ml] every minute, max 500 mcg [5 ml]), titrate to achieve BP/radial pulse
        - 0.1 mg/ml concentration IV ONLY, slow IV
    5. IV NORMAL SALINE BOLUS 20 ml/kg to maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 or radial pulses

### Hypovolemic, Neurogenic, Cardiogenic, and Septic Shock

#### General Shock Management
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Airway Protocol
3. IV/IO Procedure
4. Apply Cardiac Monitor and Assess Vitals
5. Measure Blood Glucose as indicated
6. Obtain Diagnostic EKG as indicated
7. IV NORMAL SALINE BOLUS 20 ml/kg (to maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 or radial pulses)
8. Monitor lung sounds for fluid overload
9. Capnography Procedure

#### Neurogenic Shock
- Consider spinal motion restriction procedure.

#### Adrenal/Addisonian Crisis (in relevant cases)
- EMS permitted to give patient-prescribed IV steroids if available (preferred). If unavailable, methylPREDISolone 125 mg IV/IO/IM/PO.

#### Cardiogenic Shock
- Consider ITD procedure.
- Consider push dose EPINEPHrine: Prepare 10 mcg/ml concentration, administer 10 mcg (1 ml) slow push, titrate to MAP > 65 or SBP 90 or radial pulses, may use up to 50 mcg (5 ml) per dose as needed.

#### Septic Shock
- Notify receiving facility: SEPSIS ALERT.
- Identify possible SIRS or severe sepsis patient using checklist.
- Consider push dose EPINEPHrine if not responding to fluids.

#### Hypovolemic Shock (Dehydration or Non-Traumatic Bleeding)
- If externally visible, non-traumatic bleeding (e.g. vaginal bleeding) with uncontrolled hemorrhage and HR > 120 and/or SBP < 90, consider tranexamic acid (TXA) 1–2 gram in 100 ml D5W over 10 min.

#### If Shock Due to HR, See Specific HR Protocol.

### Push Dose EPINEPHrine Preparation
- Mix 1 mg EPINEPHrine of 1 mg/ml in 100 ml of D5 or Normal Saline. This makes 10 mcg/ml concentration. Shake well to mix. Draw from bag, administer 10 mcg (1 ml) prn – titrated to maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90. May give up to 50 mcg (5 ml) per dose if required.

## Indications

* Physiologic (Pregnancy)

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Skin, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Back, Extremities, Neuro.
* Hypotension can be defined as a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 or MAP less than 65.
* Consider orthostatic vital signs in non-trauma patients with suspected blood or fluid loss.
* Consider all possible shock causes and treat per protocol.
* Anaphylactic Shock:
    - Involvement of 2 or more body systems warrants consideration. Consider IM EPINEPHrine.
    - Do not confuse EPINEPHrine 1 mg/ml (IM) and 0.1 mg/ml (IV).
    - Treat patients with history of anaphylaxis aggressively.
    - Remove stingers if possible.
* Cardiogenic Shock:
    - Circulatory failure is due to inadequate cardiac function.
    - Consider congenital heart defects.
    - Suspect in MI patients with no volume-related shock.
    - Pulmonary edema or CHF may cause cardiogenic shock.
    - Marked, symptomatic tachycardia and bradycardia also cause cardiogenic shock—fix rate first.
* Hypovolemic Shock:
    - Trauma-related hemorrhagic shock should be treated per trauma criteria, with rapid transport.
    - Initiate second large bore IV, resuscitate to MAP ≥65 or SBP 90 (100 SBP if >70 years old) or radial pulses.
* Septic Shock:
    - Aggressive fluid resuscitation, consider vasopressors if not responding to fluid.
    - Be alert in elderly.
* Addisonian/Adrenal Crisis:
    - Not a field diagnosis; patients/families should be aware.
    - Present with dehydration, severe vomiting/diarrhea, stabbing abd/lumbar/leg pain, hypotension, shock, low blood sugar, LOC loss.
    - Emergent steroid administration; use patient supplied steroids before EMS supplied if available.
