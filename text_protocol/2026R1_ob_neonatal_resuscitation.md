# Childbirth / Obstetrical Emergencies: Neonatal Resuscitation

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol (For Mother)
2. Dry Infant and Keep Warm
3. Assess Respirations
    1. Maintain body heat of infant during and post resuscitation
    2. Suction only if airway appears obstructed
4. If Respirations Present:
    1. Attempt to maintain these Newborn Oxygen Saturation levels:
       - 1 Min: 60-65%
       - 2 Min: 65-70%
       - 3 Min: 70-75%
       - 4 Min: 75-80%
       - 5 Min: 80-85%
       - 10 Min: 85-95%
5. If Not Breathing:
    1. BVM 30 seconds at 40–60 breaths per minute with ROOM AIR
    2. OXYGEN Blow-By
6. Assess Heart Rate
7. Continue with further steps as necessary:
    1. Score at 1 min and 5 min APGAR
    2. Reassess Heart Rate
    3. Begin sub-procedures outlined below as indicated by heart rate and response

### Neonatal Resuscitation Decision Pathway

If HR > 100:
1. Stimulate infant and note APGAR score at 1 min and 5 min
2. Monitor and reassess
3. If effective ventilations:
    1. Use NEONATAL AIRWAY PROTOCOL
    2. Continue monitoring & reassessment
    3. If needed, consider NORMAL SALINE BOLUS 10 ml/kg

If HR 60–100:
1. BVM 30 seconds at 40–60 breaths per minute with ROOM AIR
2. Reassess Heart Rate
    1. If HR 80–100, continue BVM, transport to appropriate facility
    2. If HR < 80, begin below pathway

If HR < 60:
1. Begin CPR at 3:1 Ratio
2. Effective ventilations/NEONATAL AIRWAY PROTOCOL
3. IV/IO/PROCEDURE as indicated below

### IV / IO / PROCEDURE (for HR < 60 or HR not improving)
1. Dextrose 10%, 2 ml/kg IV/IO if Glucose < 45 prn
2. EPINEPHrine 0.02 mg/kg IV/IO or 0.1 mg/kg ETT of 0.1 mg/ml concentration (repeat every 3–5 minutes; double check EPI concentration)
3. Consider NORMAL SALINE BOLUS 10 ml/kg
4. Reassess Heart Rate

### Transport and Consultation
1. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
2. CONTACT receiving facility
3. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
4. APPROPRIATE transfer of care

## Indications
* Newborn/neonate requiring resuscitation at delivery
* Neonatal respiratory or cardiac distress

## Signs and Symptoms
* Respiratory distress
* Peripheral cyanosis or mottling (normal)
* Central cyanosis (abnormal)
* Altered level of responsiveness
* Bradycardia

## Differential Diagnosis
* Airway failure
* Secretions
* Respiratory drive
* Infection
* Maternal medication effect
* Hypovolemia
* Hypoglycemia
* Congenital heart disease
* Hypothermia

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Skin, HEENT, Neck, Chest, Heart, Abdomen, Extremities, Neuro
* Newborn arrest is not a cardiac arrest, it is a respiratory arrest.
* Effective ventilation is key to successful resuscitation.
* Effective ventilation can be determined by; Chest rise, Bilateral breath sounds, and Increasing heart rate.
* Term baby resuscitation should begin with room air.
* If preterm baby, resuscitate with oxygen, but reservoir removed from BVM.
* Hypothermia is a common complication of home and field deliveries. Keep the baby warm and dry.
* Consider hypoglycemia in infant. If the BGL is less than 45 mg/dl then administer Dextrose 10%.
* Document 1 and 5-minute APGAR scores, but do not use it to guide your resuscitation steps.
* If the patient is in distress, consider causes such as; hypovolemia. Administer a 10 ml/kg fluid bolus of normal saline.
* If drying and suction has not provided enough stimulation, try rubbing the infant’s back or flicking their feet. If the infant still has poor respiratory effort, poor tone, or central cyanosis, consider them to be distressed, most distressed infants will respond quickly to BVM.
* Use caution not to allow newborns to slip from grasp.
* Gestation less than 20 weeks are not viable and considered stillbirth. Fundus at the umbilicus or greater. Greater than 20 weeks and deceased are coroners cases.
* After delivery, drying, and stimulation place baby on mother skin to skin to prevent hypothermia if the newborn does not require resuscitation. Prevent hypothermia in all cases.

## Other Information

**History**
* Due date and gestational age
* Multiple gestation (twins etc.)
