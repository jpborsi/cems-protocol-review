# ASYSTOLE / PULSELESS ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY (PEA)

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Criteria for Death
3. IV / IO Procedure
4. Apply Cardiac Monitor / AED
5. Airway Protocol
6. Capnography Procedure
7. Continue CPR
    1. Minimize interruptions to chest compressions.
    2. Confirm asystole in more than one lead.
    3. Discuss with Online Medical Control to assist with differential diagnosis and treatment options.
    4. Consider treatable causes in all PEA/asystole (see “Consider Treatable Causes” section).
8. Epinephrine 1 mg IV/IO of 0.1 mg/ml every 3-5 minutes as soon as possible after vascular access.
9. Known dialysis patient or history concerning for hyperkalemia:
    1. Flush IV line then Sodium Bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg up to 200 mEq IV/IO.
    2. Flush IV line then Calcium Gluconate 3 grams SLOW IV/IO OR Calcium Chloride 1 gram SLOW IV/IO.
    3. Do NOT mix with Sodium Bicarbonate in same line.
10. If at any time, Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC): Go to Post Resuscitation Cardiac Care Protocol.
11. Transport to appropriate facility as indicated.
12. Termination of efforts:
    1. ALS: May consider termination after criteria are met (see “Field Termination - ALS”).
    2. BLS: May consider termination after criteria are met (see “Field Termination - BLS”).

### Field Termination – ALS
Criteria for considering termination:
1. Arrest not witnessed by EMS/first responders
2. Advanced airway in place
3. Vascular access in place
4. Continuous CPR during resuscitation
5. At least 2 rounds of ACLS medications
6. Asystole confirmed in 2 leads or bradycardic wide complex PEA
7. 20 minutes of resuscitation efforts
8. An intra-arrest capnography reading <10 indicates no perfusion and may be helpful in considering termination of efforts.

### Field Termination – BLS
Criteria for considering termination:
1. Arrest not witnessed by EMS/first responders
2. No ROSC has been obtained after 20 min of CPR
3. Non-shockable rhythm

### Patients Awakening During CPR
If patient awakens during CPR or CPR device use, despite a non-life sustaining rhythm that interferes with treatment consider:
1. Ketamine – Use usual adult dosing, repeat as needed to yield patient response permitting resuscitation.
2. Fentanyl – Use usual adult dosing.
3. Midazolam – Use usual adult dosing.
4. Lorazepam – Use usual adult dosing.

## Indications
* Pulseless patient
* Apneic patient
* No electrical activity on ECG
* Suspected cardiac arrest due to medical or traumatic cause

## Signs and Symptoms
* Pulseless
* Apneic
* No electrical activity on ECG
* Cyanosis

## Differential Diagnosis
* Medical vs. trauma
* Hypoxia
* Potassium (hypo/hyper)
* Acidosis
* Hypothermia
* Device (lead) error
* Death
* Hypovolemia
* Cardiac tamponade
* Drug overdose (tricyclics, digitalis, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers)
* Massive myocardial infarction
* Tension pneumothorax
* Pulmonary embolus

## Consider Treatable Causes
* Hypovolemia
* Hypo-hyperkalemia
* Hypoxia
* Hypoglycemia
* Hydrogen ion (acidosis)
* Hypothermia
* Toxins
* Tamponade (cardiac)
* Tension pneumothorax
* Thrombosis (coronary or pulmonary)
* Trauma

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status
* Always minimize interruptions to chest compressions.
* When IV access failed or difficult, humeral head IO are preferred routes over tibial IO for resuscitation.
* Always confirm asystole in more than one lead.
* Consider each possible cause listed in the differential: Survival is based on identifying and correcting the cause!
* Discussion with Online Medical Control can be a valuable tool in developing a differential diagnosis and identifying possible treatment options.
* If the patient converts to another rhythm, refer to the appropriate protocol and treat accordingly.
* Early identification and treatment of reversible causes of PEA increases the chance of a successful outcome.
* Consider volume infusion for all patients in PEA. Be alert for fluid overload.
* Treat as ventricular fibrillation if you cannot differentiate between asystole and fine ventricular fibrillation.
* Dextrose should only be administered to a patient with a confirmed blood glucose level less than 70 mg / dl.
* If patient is pregnant and in cardiac arrest, manually manipulate the uterus to the left during CPR.
* Strongly encourage transport of resuscitated patient to facility with PCI where available.

## Other Information
* Refer to DOA Guidelines for Criteria for Death.
* Contact Online Medical Control for guidance on DNR/Comfort Care, uncommon scenarios, or when considering termination of resuscitative efforts.
* Transport: Contact receiving facility, consult Medical Control where indicated, ensure appropriate transfer of care.
* Patients in cardiac arrest should be worked on scene unless special resuscitation circumstances exist that would benefit from hospital treatment unavailable in the field.
* Capnography is recommended for intra-arrest management; a reading <10 indicates no perfusion and may inform the decision to terminate efforts.
* Review DNR Comfort Care Guidelines as appropriate.
* For patients with suspected or known hyperkalemia: administer Sodium Bicarbonate and Calcium, flush IV lines between medications, and do not mix in the same line.
