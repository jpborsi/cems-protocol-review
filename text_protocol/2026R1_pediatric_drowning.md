# Pediatric Protocol: Drowning

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. CONSIDER SPINAL MOTION RESTRICTION PROCEDURE
3. PEDIATRIC AIRWAY PROTOCOL
    1. Initiate ventilation while patient is still in water if not breathing.
    2. Provide high flow oxygen ASAP.
4. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
5. Apply Cardiac Monitor
6. IF HYPOTHERMIC
    1. Treat per Hypothermia Protocol
7. IV / IO PROCEDURE
    1. Normal Saline TKO
8. Monitor and Reassess
9. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
10. CONTACT receiving facility
11. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
12. APPROPRIATE transfer of care

### Decompression Sickness
If decompression sickness is suspected:
1. Give oxygen – no positive pressure ventilation unless NOT breathing.

## Indications
* Submersion in water regardless of depth
* Possible trauma (e.g., fall, diving board)
* Duration of immersion
* Temperature of water
* Salt vs. fresh water
* Period of unconsciousness

## Signs and Symptoms
* Unresponsive
* Mental status changes
* Decreased or absent vital signs
* Vomiting
* Coughing

## Differential Diagnosis
* Trauma
* Pre-existing medical problem
* Barotrauma (diving)
* Decompression sickness

## Key Points
* Exam: Trauma Survey, Head, Neck, Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis, Back, Extremities, Skin, Neuro
* Drowning due to suffocation from submersion in water.
* 2 causes – breath holding which leads to aspiration of water; & laryngospasm which closes the glottis.
* Both causes lead to profound hypoxia and death.
* Fresh water drowning ventricular fibrillation may be likely.
* Salt water drowning may cause pulmonary edema in time.
* Pulmonary edema can develop within 24 - 48 hours after submersion.
* EMS should be aware that there may be delayed symptoms in some cases.
* Patients WITHOUT vital sign abnormalities may follow standard refusal of care protocols.
* Drowning is a leading cause of death among would-be rescuers.
* Allow appropriately trained and certified rescuers to remove victims from areas of danger.
* With pressure injuries (decompression / barotrauma), consider transport for availability of a hyperbaric chamber.
* All hypothermic / drowning patients should have resuscitation performed until care is transferred, or if there are other signs of obvious death (putrification, traumatic injury unsustainable to life).
* Consider SPINAL MOTION RESTRICTION in all drowning cases.
* Patients with low core temperatures will not respond to ALS drug interventions. Maintain warming procedures and supportive care.
* DO NOT perform the Heimlich maneuver to remove water from the lungs prior to resuscitation.
