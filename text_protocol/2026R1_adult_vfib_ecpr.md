# VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION / PULSELESS VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA for ECPR Departments

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
    1. Apply Cardiac Monitor
    2. Defibrillator / AED – Confirm V-Fib / V-Tach
    3. Airway Protocol
    4. Refer to DOA Guidelines / Criteria for Death
    5. Contact Online Medical Control as indicated
2. Review DNR Comfort Care Guidelines
3. If Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC), go to Post Resuscitation Cardiac Care protocol
4. If initial defibrillation fails and ECPR center is within 30 minutes transport time, move towards transport
5. Continue standard of care treatments enroute; reassess rhythm
6. Evaluate ECPR Criteria (see below)
    1. If criteria met, immediately notify receiving ECPR center
7. Throughout care:
    1. Immediately resume CPR after each intervention for 2 minutes
    2. Apply Capnography Procedure
    3. Establish IV/IO access

### Management of Refractory VF/VT

1. Defibrillate 200 J or device recommendation
2. Immediately resume CPR for 2 minutes
3. Reassess rhythm
4. Defibrillate 300 J or device recommendation
5. Immediately resume CPR for 2 minutes
6. Reassess rhythm
7. Defibrillate 360 J or device recommendation. Repeat for additional rhythm checks.
8. Administer Epinephrine 1 mg IV/IO of 0.1 mg/ml every 3–5 minutes
9. Provide one antiarrhythmic during CPR:
    1. Amiodarone 300 mg IV/IO (may repeat at 150 mg IV/IO in 3–5 minutes; max 450 mg)
    2. If Amiodarone unavailable, see medication section for Lidocaine
10. Consider Magnesium Sulfate 2 grams over 1–2 minutes IV/IO (for Torsades, Alcoholism, Malnutrition only; may repeat once, max 4 g)
11. Known dialysis patient or history concerning for hyperkalemia:
    1. Flush IV line then administer Calcium Gluconate 3 grams SLOW IV/IO OR Calcium Chloride 1 gram SLOW IV/IO q 5 mins prn if available (DO NOT MIX with Sodium Bicarbonate in same line)
    2. Flush IV line then administer Sodium Bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg up to 200 mEq IV/IO
12. If patient awakens during CPR or CPR device use despite a non-life-sustaining rhythm that interferes with treatment, consider:
    1. Ketamine
    2. Fentanyl
    3. Midazolam
    4. Lorazepam
    5. Use usual adult dosing. Repeat as needed to yield patient response permitting resuscitation.

### ECPR Criteria

Branch and decision information:
- Inclusion Criteria:
    * Approximate age 18–70 years
    * Witnessed arrest
    * Initial rhythm VT/VF
    * Expected transport time to hospital providing ECPR < 30 minutes
    * Able to provide mechanical CPR
    * End Tidal CO2 > 10
- Exclusion Criteria:
    * Clear advanced directives with DNR status
    * Long term care facility/nursing home
    * Known terminal illness

1. If inclusion and no exclusion criteria, immediately notify receiving ECPR center and move toward ambulance for transport
2. Continue standard of care enroute
3. Consult with ECPR center if any unique considerations or if case is not explicitly included in the criteria

## Indications
* Unresponsive, apneic, pulseless patient
* Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia on ECG

## Signs and Symptoms
* Estimated down time
* Unresponsive, apneic, pulseless
* Medical history includes: renal failure/dialysis, medications, events leading to arrest
* DNR

## Differential Diagnosis
* Asystole
* Artifact/device failure
* Cardiac
* Endocrine/metabolic
* Drugs
* Pulmonary embolus

## Key Points

### ECPR
* If shockable rhythm and in area with ECPR (ECMO CPR) capability at receiving hospital, those ECPR guidelines for resuscitation and abbreviated field treatment may be followed
* If ROSC is achieved during transport, EMS should continue to the ECPR center they were originally transporting to
* Standard treatments for V-FIB / V-Tach apply during transport if ECPR criteria met
* Specific cases not explicitly included in the inclusion or exclusion criteria should be discussed with the ECPR center real time
* Successful outcomes of ECPR hinge on early identification, early notification of ECPR center, and timely transport and transfer of the patient
* Mechanical CPR is paramount during care for maintenance of quality CPR – apply as soon as possible

### V-FIB / V-TACH
* Exam: Mental Status
* Always minimize interruptions to chest compressions
* When IV access failed or difficult, humeral head IO are preferred routes over tibial IO for resuscitation
* Effective CPR should be as continuous as possible with minimum of 5 cycles or 2 minutes
* Reassess and document endotracheal tube placement and capnography frequently, after every move, and at discharge
* Polymorphic V-Tach (Torsades de Pointes) may benefit from administration of Magnesium Sulfate
* If the patient converts to another rhythm, or has a return of circulation, refer to the appropriate protocol and treat accordingly
* If the patient converts back to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia after being converted to ANY other rhythm, defibrillate at the previous setting used
* Defibrillation following effective CPR is the definitive therapy for ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Magnesium Sulfate should be administered early in the arrest if hypomagnesemia (chronic alcoholic or malnourished patients) is suspected
* If patient is pregnant and in cardiac arrest, manually manipulate the uterus to the left during CPR
* Zoll and Phillips equivalency settings are 120, 150, 200 Joules to Physio Control / Stryker 200, 300, 360 Joules. If unsure about settings use highest joule setting per AHA
* Damage to defibrillators during double sequential defibrillation may not be covered by manufacturers—use the technique with prior approval from your department
* Dextrose should only be administered to a patient with a confirmed blood glucose level less than 70 mg/dl
