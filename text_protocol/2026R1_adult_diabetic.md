# Diabetic Emergencies

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Blood Glucose Procedure
3. IV Procedure
4. Monitor and Reassess
    1. Glucose < 70 or symptomatic
    2. Glucose 70 – 250
    3. Glucose > 250
5. Diagnostic EKG Procedure
6. Transport to appropriate facility
7. Contact receiving facility
8. Consult Medical Control where indicated
9. Appropriate transfer of care

### Hypoglycemia Treatment
Criteria: Blood glucose < 70 mg/dL or symptomatic patient (regardless of glucose level).

1. Oral Glucose 15–37.5 grams – may repeat as needed (Only if alert)
2. Thiamine 100 mg IV or IM – No repeat (If chronic alcoholism or malnourished)
3. If Vascular Access:
    1. Dextrose 10%
        - Glucose < 40 mg/dL: 25 grams IV/IO
        - Glucose 40 – 70 mg/dL: 12.5 grams IV/IO
        - May repeat as needed
        - If Dextrose 10% is unavailable, see medication section for Dextrose 50%
4. If No Vascular Access:
    1. Glucagon 1 mg IM – every 10 min as needed, Max 2 mg
        - Long time to onset of action
        - EMT may administer only with proper training
5. For alcoholic or malnourished patients, give Thiamine before giving glucose.
6. Recheck Blood Glucose Level
7. Shut off wearable insulin pumps if patient is hypoglycemic.

### Hyperglycemia Treatment
Criteria: Blood glucose > 250 mg/dL

1. Normal Saline 20 ml/kg if signs/symptoms of dehydration and no contraindications.
2. No diabetic treatment required for glucose 70 – 250 mg/dL.
3. Recheck Blood Glucose Level.

## Indications
* Known diabetic or medic alert tag
* Past medical history of diabetes
* Medications (especially insulin or oral hypoglycemics)
* Last meal
* Recent blood sugar analysis or BGL check

## Signs and Symptoms

**Hypoglycemia**
* Altered level of consciousness
* Dizziness
* Irritability
* Diaphoresis
* Convulsions
* Hunger
* Confusion

**Hyperglycemia**
* Altered level of consciousness / coma
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea / vomiting
* Dehydration
* Frequent thirst and urination
* General weakness, malaise
* Hypovolemic shock
* Hyperventilation
* Deep / rapid respirations

## Differential Diagnosis

**Hypoglycemia**
* ETOH
* Toxic Overdose
* Trauma
* Seizure
* Syncope
* CNS disorder
* Stroke
* Pre-existing condition

**Hyperglycemia**
* ETOH
* Toxic overdose
* Trauma
* Seizure
* Syncope
* CNS disorder
* Stroke
* Diabetic ketoacidosis

## Key Points
* Hypoglycemic patients who are receiving oral hypoglycemics should be STRONGLY urged to be transported to the hospital. The half-life of such oral medications is long, and these patients will need to be closely monitored for recurrent hypoglycemia.
* Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a complication of diabetes mellitus. It can occur when insulin levels become inadequate to meet the metabolic demands of the body for a prolonged amount of time (onset can be within 12 - 24 hours). Without enough insulin, the blood glucose increases, and cellular glucose depletes. The body removes excess blood glucose by dumping it into the urine. Pediatric patients in DKA should be treated as hyperglycemic under the Pediatric Diabetic Emergency Protocol.
* Patients can have hyperglycemia without having DKA.
* Always suspect hypoglycemia in patients with an altered mental status.
* If a blood glucose analysis is not available, a patient with altered mental status and signs and symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia should receive Dextrose or Glucagon.
* Dextrose is used to elevate BGL but it will not maintain it. The patient will need to follow up with a meal (carbs), if not transported to a hospital.
* If IV access is successful after Glucagon IM and the patient is still symptomatic, Dextrose IV/IO can be administered.
* For alcoholic or malnourished patients, give 100 mg Thiamine IV or IM before giving glucose to avoid possible Wernicke’s encephalopathy.
* Shut off wearable insulin pumps if patient is hypoglycemic.
* Treat if the patient’s blood glucose is 70 or less, or any level with signs and symptoms.
* Glucagon unlikely to be useful in malnourished patients.
