# Respiratory Distress / Asthma / COPD

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. OXYGEN
3. DIAGNOSTIC EKG PROCEDURE  
    1. 1ST Contact to EKG and Transmission < 10 Min
4. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
5. CONTACT receiving facility
6. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
7. APPROPRIATE transfer of care

### Mild – Severe Distress
Criteria: Patient with respiratory distress not peri-arrest/not moving air.

1. Oxygen as needed
2. Continuous pulse oximetry
3. Repeat aerosols as needed:  
    * ALBUTEROL / IPRATROPIUM  
    * CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
4. If unresolved or worsening distress, treat as Moderate/Severe Distress.

### Peri-Arrest / Not Moving Air

Criteria: Severe distress, patient peri-arrest or not moving air.

1. AIRWAY PROTOCOL
2. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
3. BE PREPARED for Emergency Airway  
    * CRICOTHYROTOMY NEEDLE, KIT, or SURGICAL (as provided and trained)  
    * If patient occludes airway, must have Med Command Training / Approval

#### Severe Distress with Stridor

1. Treat with aerosol RACEMIC EPINEPHRINE  
   * Unit Dose (2.25% 0.5ml) mixed in 3ml of Normal Saline  
   * Nebulized – No Repeat
   * NOT for Foreign Body Airway Obstructions
   * If Racemic Epinephrine is unavailable, see medication section for aerosol EPINEPHrine 1mg/ml
2. methylPREDNISolone 125 mg IV/IO/IM – No Repeat

### Moderate / Severe Distress

Criteria: Increased work of breathing.

1. Oxygen as needed
2. Consider CPAP PROCEDURE  
    * Do not use if Hypotension  
    * Do not use if Untreated Vomiting
3. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
4. Treat with aerosol:  
    * ALBUTEROL / IPRATROPIUM  
    * EMT may administer only with proper training or ONLINE Medical Control
5. methylPREDNISolone 125 mg IV/IO/IM/PO – No Repeat
6. Consider MAGNESIUM SULFATE 2 Grams IV over 20 minutes

### Unresolved or Worsening Distress – Moderate / Severe Management

1. Treat with CONTINUOUS aerosols ALBUTEROL / IPRATROPIUM  
    * Oxygen as needed  
    * EMT may administer only with proper training or ONLINE Medical Control
2. EPINEPHrine 1 mg / ml 0.3 – 0.5 mg IM – q 5 min prn
3. methylPREDNISolone 125 mg IV/IO/IM/PO – No Repeat
4. MAGNESIUM SULFATE 2 Grams IV over 20 minutes

## Indications

* Asthma
* COPD – chronic bronchitis, emphysema, congestive heart failure
* Home treatment (oxygen, nebulizer)
* Medications (Theophylline, steroids, inhalers)
* Toxic exposure, smoke inhalation

## Signs and Symptoms

* Shortness of breath
* Pursed lip breathing
* Decreased ability to speak
* Increased respiratory rate and effort
* Wheezing, rhonchi
* Use of accessory muscles
* Fever, cough
* Tachycardia
* Tripod position

## Differential Diagnosis

* Asthma
* Anaphylaxis
* Aspiration
* COPD (emphysema, bronchitis)
* Pleural effusion
* Pneumonia
* Pulmonary embolus
* Pneumothorax
* Cardiac (MI or CHF)
* Pericardial tamponade
* Hyperventilation
* Inhaled toxin (Carbon monoxide, etc.)

## Key Points

* Exam: Mental Status, HEENT, Skin, Neck, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremities, Neuro
* Status asthmaticus - severe prolonged asthma attack unresponsive to therapy - life threatening!
* If the patient is over 50 years of age, has a history of cardiac disease, or if the patient's heart rate is >120 EPINEPHrine may precipitate cardiac ischemia.
* Monitor pulse oximetry continuously during treatment and transport.
* A silent chest in respiratory distress is a pre-respiratory arrest sign.
* Be alert for respiratory depression in COPD patients on prolonged high flow oxygen administration.
* DO NOT withhold oxygen from hypoxic patients.
* If Albuterol and/or Ipratropium are given, monitor the patient’s cardiac rhythm and initiate IV.
* Patient with known COPD, asthma and a history of steroid use should receive IV MethylPREDNISolone (Solu-Medrol). Use with caution in diabetics (hyperglycemia), GI bleeds, and febrile patients (sepsis/infections).
* Assure enough expiration time when ventilating COPD or asthma patients to prevent breath stacking and allow for CO2 elimination.
* Albuterol and Ipratropium can be given down an ETT or tracheostomy during ventilation if there is evidence of bronchoconstriction.
* IM epinephrine not helpful in COPD or Emphysema. Utilized for severe asthma.

## Other Information

* CPAP should be used as a last resort in asthmatic / COPD patients who are HYPOXEMIC. Prepare to intubate and ventilate.
* SEVERE ASTHMA / STATUS ASTHMATICUS patients not moving air or not moving the mist from an aerosol treatment give EPINEPHrine 1 mg / ml 0.3 - 0.5 mg IM.
