# Chest Trauma

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Bleeding / Hemorrhage Control Procedure
3. Airway Protocol
4. Spinal Motion Restriction Protocol
5. Apply Cardiac Monitor
6. Capnography Procedure
7. High Flow Oxygen
    1. Flail Chest: Assist with Ventilation – Gentle Positive Pressure 
        * Consider CPAP if isolated chest trauma and no hypotension / shock / tension pneumothorax and spontaneous adequate respiration.
    2. Cardiac Tamponade: Assess for Beck’s Triad (Hypotension, +JVD and muffled heart sounds).
        * Paradoxical Pulse (no radial pulse when breathing in) is likely.
    3. Massive Hemothorax: Shock, then difficulty breathing. No JVD, decreased breath sounds, dull to percussion.
    4. Open Pneumothorax / Sucking Chest Wound: Close wound with occlusive dressing secured on THREE SIDES or Commercial Chest Seal.
    5. If evidence of current / previous uncontrolled hemorrhage, HR > 120 and / or SBP < 90, within 60 mins of injury:
        * Consider TRANEXAMIC ACID (TXA)
            - 2 Grams (2000 mg) IV / IO slow push over 10 min
            - or 2 Grams IV / IO (2000 mg) mixed in 100 ml D5W over 10 mins
    6. Suspected: Traumatic Aortic Rupture, Tracheal or Bronchial Tree Injury, Myocardial Contusion, Diaphragmatic Tears, Esophageal Injury, And Pulmonary Contusion:
        * Ensure an Airway, Administer Oxygen, LOAD AND GO
8. LOAD AND GO for all above critical findings.
9. IV / IO Procedure to maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 (100 systolic if >70 years old) if MAP Unavailable or Radial Pulses.

### Traumatic Needle Chest Decompression Procedure
If Signs & Symptoms of Tension Pneumothorax (difficulty bagging, absent breath sounds, hypotensive or pulseless):

1. Perform Needle Chest Decompression.
2. Be prepared to repeat if signs & symptoms return.

### Transport and Notification
1. Transport to appropriate facility.
2. Contact receiving facility.
3. Consult Medical Control where indicated.
4. Appropriate transfer of care.
5. Initiate Trauma Alert.

## Differential Diagnosis
* Traumatic Aortic Rupture
* Esophageal Injury
* Myocardial Contusion
* Diaphragmatic Tears
* Tracheal / Bronchial Tree Injury
* Pulmonary Contusion

## Key Points
* Thoracic injuries have been called the deadly dozen. The first six are obvious at the primary assessment:
    1. Airway obstruction
    2. Flail chest
    3. Cardiac tamponade
    4. Massive hemothorax
    5. Open pneumothorax
    6. Tension pneumothorax
* The second six injuries may be more subtle and not easily found in the field:
    7. Traumatic aortic rupture
    8. Esophageal injury
    9. Myocardial contusion
    10. Diaphragmatic tears
    11. Tracheal / bronchial tree injury
    12. Pulmonary contusion
* A sucking chest wound is when the thorax is open to the outside. The occlusive dressing may be anything such as petroleum gauze, plastic, or a defibrillator pad. Tape only 3 sides down so that excess intrathoracic pressure can escape, preventing a tension pneumothorax. May help respirations to place patient on the injured side, allowing unaffected lung to expand easier.
* A flail chest is when there are extensive rib fractures present, causing a loose segment of the chest wall resulting in paradoxical and ineffective air movement. Positive pressure breathing via BVM will help push the segment and the normal chest wall out with inhalation and to move inward together with exhalation, getting them working together again. Do not use too much pressure to prevent additional damage or pneumothorax.
* A penetrating object must be immobilized by any means possible. If it is very large, cutting may be possible, with care taken not to move it about when making the cut. Place an occlusive and bulky dressing over the entry wound.
* A tension pneumothorax is life threatening, look for HYPOTENSION, unequal breath sounds, JVD, increasing respiratory distress, and decreasing mental status. The pleura must be decompressed with a needle to provide relief. Decompress between the 2nd and 3rd ribs, midclavicular placing the catheter over the 3rd rib. Alternate site, 5th intercostal space mid axillary or anterior axillary line. Once the catheter is placed, watch closely for re-occlusion. Repeat if needed to prevent re-occlusion. Decompress with 3.25” 14 ga catheter or Chest Decompression Needle based on patient’s size.

## Other Information
* If S&S of Tension Pneumothorax: (Difficulty bagging, absent breath sounds, hypotensive or pulseless) perform traumatic needle chest decompression. Be prepared to repeat if signs & symptoms return.
* Place an occlusive and bulky dressing over the entry wound in case of penetrating object.
