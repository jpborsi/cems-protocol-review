# CRUSH INJURY / CRUSH SYNDROME

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Initiate Trauma Alert
3. Bleeding / Hemorrhage Control Procedure
4. Consider Spinal Motion Restriction Procedure
5. Transport to appropriate facility
6. Contact receiving facility
7. Consult Medical Control where indicated
8. Appropriate transfer of care
9. Airway Protocol
10. Pain Management Protocol
11. IV / IO Procedure – Prior to extrication  
    1. 1000 ml bolus to maintain kidney perfusion
    2. TKO thereafter unless evidence of hypoperfusion
    3. Then additional boluses to maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 (100 systolic if >70 years old)
    4. If MAP unavailable or Radial Pulses present, maintain perfusion
12. Diagnostic EKG Procedure q 30 mins
13. Capnography Procedure
14. Rapid Trauma Assessment
    1. Throughout care, monitor for signs of compartment syndrome such as: pain disproportionate to exam, tense swelling, pain with passive stretch, muscle weakness, absent pulses, paresthesia
    2. Document assessment of distal pulses if able
    3. Early notification for potential surgical intervention

### Treatment Pathway: Release Time Considerations
If extrication (release) is anticipated, treatment splits into less than or greater than 1 hour to release:

#### Less than 1 Hour to Release
1. Reassess including Diagnostic EKG’s

#### Greater than 1 Hour to Release
1. Consider Tourniquet Procedure
    1. Prior to release, apply but do not tighten in anticipation of bleeding

### Hyperkalemia Management
1. If at any time EKG evidence of hyperkalemia (wide complex QRS or peaked T waves or bradycardia or any combination of these) is observed:
    1. Treat per Hyperkalemia Protocol
    2. Sodium Bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg, max 100 mEq/dose q 30 mins
    3. Albuterol 10 mg (4 x 2.5 mg unit doses)
        - Albuterol only – no Ipratropium
    4. Flush IV then administer
        - Calcium Gluconate 3 grams IV/IO or
        - Calcium Chloride 1 gram IV/IO
        - May repeat if available and EKG changes reoccur

## Indications
* Traumatic crush mechanism
* Non-traumatic swelling of limb

## Signs and Symptoms
* Pain disproportionate to exam
* Tense swelling
* Pain with passive stretch
* Muscle weakness
* Absent pulses
* Paresthesia

## Differential Diagnosis
* Compartment syndrome
* Contusions
* Crush syndrome
* Degloving injury
* Fracture(s)
* Laceration(s)
* Peripheral nerve injury
* Tendon injury
* Vascular injury
* Rhabdomyolysis
* Localized allergic reactions
* Cellulitis

## Key Points
* Care goals include recognizing traumatic crush injury mechanism and minimizing the systemic effects such as rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury
* Rapid extrication and evacuation to a definitive care facility (trauma center preferred)
* A patient with a crush injury may initially present with very few signs and symptoms. Maintain a high index of suspicion for any patient with a compressive mechanism of injury
* A fatal medical complication of crush syndrome is hyperkalemia. Suspect hyperkalemia if T-waves become peaked, QRS becomes prolonged (greater than 0.12 seconds), absent P wave, prolonged QTc, or sine wave. Continue fluid resuscitation through extrication and transfer to hospital
* Non-traumatic injuries that may cause compartment syndrome include prolonged immobilization, prolonged compression of the torso/limbs, electrical injury, or burns
* Key Documentation Elements include: Time of tourniquet application, neurovascular status of any crushed extremity, EKG findings consistent with hyperkalemia, and amount of IV fluid administered
* Place a tourniquet on any trapped extremities if accessible above the crush area prior to release in preparation of post release bleeding

## Other Information
* Consider air transport if delay due to extrication
