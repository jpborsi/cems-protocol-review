# ALCOHOL / WITHDRAWAL RELATED EMERGENCIES

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. Apply Cardiac Monitor and Assess Vitals
3. Rule out other causes / concurrent issues
    1. Consider Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Shock, Cardiac, Medical, Trauma causes.
4. Determine clinical presentation and proceed with appropriate sub-procedure:
    1. Mild Symptoms
    2. Violent / Combative
    3. Obtunded

### Mild Symptoms
* Criteria: Nausea, vomiting, headache, dehydration, protecting own airway, dizzy, lightheaded, responsive
1. Oxygen to maintain SpO2 >94% by nasal cannula when possible
2. IV Normal Saline Bolus 20 ml/kg if signs of dehydration or to maintain MAP >65 or SBP 90 if MAP unavailable or palpable radial pulses
3. Treat per NAUSEA AND VOMITING PROTOCOL
4. Transport to appropriate facility
5. Contact receiving facility and consult Medical Control where indicated
6. Appropriate transfer of care
7. Diagnostic EKG Procedure, if indicated

### Violent / Combative
* Criteria: Combative, violent, irrational behavior, threat to self or others
1. Summon Law Enforcement
2. Make scene safe
3. Transport restrained or medicated patients supine or in lateral position only
4. If patient is agitated:
    * Consider MIDAZOLAM 2.5 mg IV/IO or 5 mg IM/IN q5 min prn – Max 10 mg  
      OR 
      LORazepam 1–2 mg IV/IO/IM/IN q10 min prn – Max 4 mg  
    * If Midazolam or LORazepam unavailable, see medication section for diazePAM
5. NAUSEA AND VOMITING PROTOCOL as needed
6. Cooling measures if febrile
7. Capnography Procedure required
8. IV Normal Saline Bolus 20 ml/kg to maintain MAP >65 or SBP 90 if MAP unavailable or palpable radial pulses
9. Diagnostic EKG Procedure as indicated

### Obtunded (Alcohol / Benzos / Barbiturate Withdrawal)
* Criteria: Chronic alcoholic, chronic benzo/barbiturate use, shaking, sweating, fever, hallucinations, seizures, tachycardia, hypertension. Unresponsive or only mildly responsive to noxious stimuli, snoring, questionable ability to protect airway, possible vomiting.
1. Protect Airway
2. Airway Protocol (Position on Left Side, have suction immediately available, consider need for advanced airway placement)
3. Blood Glucose Procedure as indicated
4. Thiamine 100 mg IV or IM (no repeat) if IV/IO Dextrose required to treat hypoglycemia in the chronic alcoholic patient
5. IV Normal Saline Bolus 20 ml/kg to maintain MAP >65 or SBP 90 if MAP unavailable or palpable radial pulses
6. Capnography Procedure required
7. Cooling measures if febrile
8. NAUSEA AND VOMITING PROTOCOL as needed
9. Transport to appropriate facility
10. Contact receiving facility and consult Medical Control where indicated
11. Appropriate transfer of care

## Indications
* Alcohol or sedative withdrawal
* Alcohol intoxication or associated emergencies
* Chronic alcoholic, chronic benzo/barbiturate use
* Combative, violent, irrational behavior, threat to self or others

## Signs and Symptoms
* Agitation, anxiety, confusion
* Affect change, hallucinations
* Delusional thoughts, bizarre behavior
* Combative, violent behavior
* Expression of suicidal/homicidal thoughts
* Nausea, vomiting, headache, dehydration
* Shaking, sweating, fever
* Hallucinations, seizures
* Tachycardia, hypertension
* Unresponsiveness, decreased ability to protect airway
* Snoring respirations, possible vomiting

## Differential Diagnosis
* Alcohol intoxication
* Toxin/substance abuse
* Medication effect or overdose
* Withdrawal syndromes
* Depression
* Bipolar (manic-depressive)
* Schizophrenia
* Anxiety disorders
* Diabetic emergencies
* See Altered Mental Status differential diagnosis

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental status, skin, heart, lungs, neuro
* Your safety first!!
* Be sure to consider all possible medical/trauma causes for behavior (hypoglycemia, overdose, substance abuse, hypoxia, head injury, seizure, etc.)
* Do not irritate the patient with a prolonged exam.
* Do not overlook the possibility of associated domestic violence or child abuse.
* The safety of on scene personnel is the priority. Protect yourself and others by summoning law enforcement to assure everyone’s safety and if necessary, to enable you to render care. Do not approach the patient if he/she is armed with a weapon.
* Be alert for rapidly changing behaviors.
* Limit patient stimulation and use de-escalation techniques.
* Handcuffs applied by law enforcement to patients NOT in custody/under arrest may be switched to soft restraints for transport.
* Handcuffs applied by law enforcement to patients IN custody/under arrest require a law enforcement officer to remain available to adjust restraints as necessary for the patient’s safety. This policy is not intended to negate the need for law enforcement personnel to use appropriate restraint equipment to establish scene control.
* Consider treatment of agitation/anxiety combativeness for patients requiring restraint procedure.
* Use of Ketamine and/or Midazolam for behavioral emergencies by AEMTs requires training and approval from the agencies Medical Director before they can use the medications off-line.
* Ketamine use in pregnancy is a risk/benefit assessment per case. Consult Medical Control if there are questions.
* Patients who have used stimulant drugs or have struggled with law enforcement may be at increased risk of metabolic acidosis.
* Rapid/deep breathing or respiratory distress may be indicative of metabolic acidosis.
