# Pediatric Protocol: Head Trauma

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
    1. Oxygen for all head trauma
2. Consider Spinal Motion Restriction Procedure
3. Consider Other Protocols
    1. Multiple Trauma Protocol (if not isolated head trauma)
    2. Altered Mental Status Protocol
    3. Seizure Protocol (if seizure activity)
4. Monitor and Reassess
5. Control Bleeding, Apply Dressing
6. Determine and Trend GCS
7. Decision Point: Isolated Uncomplicated Head Trauma?
    1. If isolated, proceed to Pediatric Airway Protocol, IV/IO Procedure as needed
    2. If evidence of, or suspect Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), proceed to relevant sub-procedures (see below)
8. Transport to appropriate facility, contact receiving facility, consult Medical Control where indicated
9. Appropriate transfer of care
10. Initiate Trauma Alert if indicated

### Pediatric Airway Protocol
Criteria: 
- Used if isolated uncomplicated head trauma or evidence of, or suspect TBI.

1. Do not hyperventilate
2. Do not allow patient to become hypoxic during any airway management
3. Maintain SpO2 > 94% at all times
4. Apply Capnography if advanced airway used
5. Ventilate to maintain CO2 35
    1. Child: 25 breaths/min
    2. Infant: 35 breaths/min

### IV/IO Procedure
Criteria:
- Initiate for evidence of, or suspect TBI, or as needed for fluid resuscitation.

1. Normal Saline Bolus to maintain SBP
2. Limit IV fluids due to cerebral edema
3. Maintain SBP
4. For fluid resuscitation: maintain systolic of 70 + 2 x age
5. Do not allow patient to become hypotensive

## Indications
* Head trauma in the pediatric patient

## Signs and Symptoms
* Pain, swelling, bleeding
* Altered mental status
* Unconscious
* Respiratory distress / failure
* Vomiting
* Major traumatic mechanism of injury
* Seizure

## Differential Diagnosis
* Skull fracture
* Brain injury (concussion, contusion, hemorrhage or laceration)
* Epidural hematoma
* Subdural hematoma
* Subarachnoid hemorrhage
* Spinal injury
* Abuse

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremities, Back, Neuro
* If GCS < 12 consider air / rapid transport and if GCS < 8 intubation should be anticipated.
* Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) may cause hypertension and bradycardia (Cushing's Response).
* Hypotension usually indicates injury or shock unrelated to the head injury.
* The most important item to monitor and document is a change in the level of consciousness.
* Concussions are periods of confusion or LOC associated with trauma, which may have resolved by the time EMS arrives. 
* A physician should evaluate any prolonged confusion or mental status abnormality, which does not return to normal within 15 minutes or any documented loss of consciousness.

## Other Information
### History
* Time of injury
* Mechanism (blunt vs. penetrating)
* Loss of consciousness
* Bleeding
* Past medical history
* Medications
* Evidence for multi-trauma

### How Can I Spot a Possible Concussion?
* Signs observed by bystanders or coaches:
    * Appears dazed or stunned
    * Is confused about assignment or position
    * Forgets instruction, unsure of score, opponent, or event
    * Moves clumsily, answers questions slowly
    * Loses consciousness
    * Shows mood, behavior, or personality changes
    * Can’t recall events just before or after a hit or fall
* Signs reported by athlete:
    * Headache or “pressure” in head
    * Nausea or vomiting
    * Balance problems or dizziness, double or blurry vision
    * Bothered by light or noise
    * Feeling sluggish, hazy, foggy, or groggy
    * Confusion, or concentration or memory problems
    * Just not “feeling right,” or “feeling down”
