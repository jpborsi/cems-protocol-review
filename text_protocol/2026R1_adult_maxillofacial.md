# Maxillofacial Trauma

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Remove Contact Lenses (If applicable)
3. Determine type of injury:
    * Eye
    * Tongue
    * Nose
    * Ear
    * Tooth
4. Have suction on and immediately available to maintain airway
5. Transport to appropriate facility
6. Contact receiving facility
7. Consult Medical Control where indicated
8. Appropriate transfer of care

### Eye Injuries
Criteria: Eye injuries, including foreign body, burns, or eye out.

1. If foreign body, determine substance
2. If chemical burn or foreign body:
    * Flush with copious amounts of normal saline
    * If unsure if something can be flushed, contact Medical Command
3. If non-penetrating trauma or chemical burns:
    * Consider topical pain control: Tetracaine 1 drop to affected eye; may repeat 1 drop, Max 2 drops
    * If Tetracaine is used, patient must be evaluated at hospital
4. If eye out:
    * Cover with sterile 4x4, normal saline and stabilize
5. If penetrating trauma:
    * Secure object (Do not remove)
6. Begin irrigating immediately; irreversible damage can occur in a few minutes

### Tongue Injuries

1. Attempt to control bleeding with direct pressure/gauze if able and will not cause airway obstruction

### Nose Injuries

1. Sit patient upright and forward
2. Pinch nostrils
3. Consider externally applied cold pack to bridge of nose
4. Attempt to control bleeding with direct pressure/gauze
5. For traumatic or atraumatic epistaxis not controlled with BLS measures:
    * Consider Tranexamic Acid (TXA) soaked gauze product nostril packing
    * Soak in standard concentration TXA
    * Have patient blow nose, suction active bleeding, then pack nostril with TXA soaked gauze
    * Resume BLS care as above

### Ear Injuries

1. Attempt to control bleeding with direct pressure/gauze

### Tooth Injuries

1. If tooth out, attempt preservation as soon as possible in:
    * Commercially available tooth preservation kit (if available)
    * Whole milk (if available)
    * Handle by enamel only; do not touch roots
2. Bleeding socket from missing teeth not controlled with BLS measures:
    * Consider Tranexamic Acid (TXA) soaked gauze product socket packing
    * Soak in standard concentration TXA
    * Resume BLS care as above

### Pain Management

* Consider PAIN MANAGEMENT Protocol

## Indications
* Trauma of any type that results in injury to one or both eyes.

## Signs and Symptoms
* Irritation to eye
* Visual disturbances
* Obvious penetrating injury
* Burn (chemical, thermal)
* Loss of vision
* Dizziness
* Loss of consciousness
* Nausea
* Hypertension
* Contact lens problem

## Differential Diagnosis
* Eye irritation
* Contact lens problem

## Key Points
* If unsure if something can be flushed with water, contact Medical Command.
* A garden hose can be used to help flush the patient’s eye(s) if available. DO NOT use a high-pressure hose or at a high force. If needed, irrigate the patient’s eyes for approximately 5–15 minutes.
* Begin irrigating immediately, because irreversible damage can occur in a few minutes.

### Trauma
* Do not allow eye injury to distract you from the basics of trauma care.
* Do not remove any foreign body imbedded in the eye or orbit. Stabilize any large protruding foreign bodies.
* With blunt trauma to the eye, if time permits, examine the globe briefly for gross laceration as the lid may be swollen tightly shut later. Sclera rupture may lie beneath an intact conjunctiva.
* Covering both eyes when only one eye is injured may help to minimize trauma to the injured eye, but in some cases the patient is too anxious to tolerate this.
* Transport patient supine unless other life threats prohibit this from being done. (This is based on physics, the goal of not letting the fluid within the eye drain out of the eye)

### Chemical Burns
* When possible determine type of chemical involved first. The eye should be irrigated with copious amounts of water or saline, using IV tubing wide open for a minimum of 15 minutes started as soon as possible. Any delay may result in serious damage to the eye.
* Always obtain name and, if possible, a sample of the contaminant or ask that they be brought to the hospital as soon as possible.

### Contact Lenses
* If possible, contact lenses should be removed from the eye; be sure to transport them to the hospital with the patient. If the lenses cannot be removed, notify the ED personnel as soon as possible.
* If the patient is conscious and alert, it is much safer and easier to have the patient remove their lenses.

### Acute, Unilateral Vision Loss
* When a patient suddenly loses vision in one eye with no pain, there may be a central retinal artery occlusion. Urgent transport and treatment is necessary.
* Patient should be transported flat.
