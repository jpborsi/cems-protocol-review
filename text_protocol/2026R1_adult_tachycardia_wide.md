# WIDE–COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA – With Pulse

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Apply Cardiac Monitor
3. Oxygen
4. Capnography Procedure
5. IV / IO Procedure
6. Patient Assessment
    1. Identify Rhythm Type: Regular or Irregular
    2. Rule out Paced Rhythm (Pacer spikes may not be present with current pacemaker technology, confirm by history/physical exam)
7. Continue with further steps as necessary (based on Rhythm stability and regularity)
    1. Diagnostic EKG Procedure
    2. Consider Vagal Maneuvers (NO carotid massage)

### Stable / Regular Wide-Complex Tachycardia
Criteria: Patient stable, regular rhythm.
1. Attempt Vagal Maneuvers (NO carotid massage)
2. Perform Diagnostic EKG Procedure
3. If Monomorphic Wide Complex Tachycardia (thought to be aberrant SVT), may consider treatment by Narrow Complex Tachycardia Protocol.
4. If not resolved:
    1. Amiodarone 150 mg IV/IO, mix in 100 ml D5W over 10 minutes
        - If HR < 130, consider other causes such as hyperkalemia
        - Must have useable Diagnostic EKG and have transmitted to hospital
        - If pregnant – use Lidocaine, see Medication Section
        - If Amiodarone unavailable, see Medication Section for Lidocaine
    2. After conversion, repeat Diagnostic EKG Procedure

### Stable / Irregular Wide-Complex Tachycardia
Criteria: Patient stable, irregular rhythm.
1. Attempt Vagal Maneuvers (NO carotid massage)
2. Consider hyperkalemia as cause and treat per Hyperkalemia protocol if EKG and history supports the decision (such as wide complex rhythm with HR < 130)
3. Perform Diagnostic EKG Procedure
4. Amiodarone 150 mg IV/IO, mix in 100 ml D5W over 10 minutes
    - If HR < 130, consider other causes such as hyperkalemia
    - Must have useable Diagnostic EKG and have transmitted to hospital
    - If pregnant – use Lidocaine, see Medication Section
    - If Amiodarone unavailable, see Medication Section for Lidocaine
5. After conversion, repeat Diagnostic EKG Procedure

### Unstable Wide-Complex Tachycardia (Regular or Irregular)
Criteria: SBP < 90, No Radial Pulses, AMS, Chest Pain, Shock
1. Synchronized Cardioversion 200 J or device recommendation
2. Consider sedation: 
    - Midazolam 2.5 mg IV/IO or 5 mg IM/IN q 5 min prn – Max 10 mg OR Lorazepam 1–2 mg IV/IO/IM/IN q 10 min prn – Max 4 mg
    - If Midazolam or Lorazepam unavailable, see Medication Section for Diazepam
3. If Torsades de pointes (polymorphic VT):
    - Defibrillate 200 J or device recommendation
    - Magnesium Sulfate 2 grams IV/IO over 20 minutes, may repeat if necessary to Max 4 grams in 1 hour
    - Repeat Defibrillation 300, 360 J or device recommendation if no response 1–2 minutes
4. For irregular rhythms / atrial fibrillation:
    - Consider medications if electricity unsuccessful
    - Amiodarone 150 mg IV/IO, mix in 100 ml D5W over 10 minutes
        - If HR < 130, consider other causes such as hyperkalemia
        - If pregnant – use Lidocaine, see Medication Section
        - If Amiodarone unavailable, see Medication Section for Lidocaine
    - If Torsades de pointes: repeat Defibrillation or administer Magnesium Sulfate as above
    - Repeat Synchronized Cardioversion 300, 360 J or device recommendation

### After Conversion
1. Perform Diagnostic EKG Procedure
2. If patient relapses back into wide complex tachycardia / ventricular tachycardia, initiate synchronized cardioversion with the joules setting that previously cardioverted the patient.

## Indications
* Wide-complex tachycardia with pulse

## Signs and Symptoms
* Ventricular tachycardia on ECG (runs or sustained)
* Conscious, rapid pulse
* Chest pain, shortness of breath
* Dizziness
* Rate usually 150+ bpm for sustained V-Tach
* Syncope / near syncope
* Palpitations

## Differential Diagnosis
* Artifact / device failure
* Cardiac
* Endocrine / metabolic
* Drugs
* Pulmonary

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Skin, Neck, Lung, Heart, Abdomen, Back, Extremities, Neuro
* Polymorphic V-Tach (Torsades de Pointes) may benefit from the administration of Magnesium Sulfate.
* Polymorphic V-Tach (Torsades de Pointes) requires defibrillation rather than synchronized cardioversion.
* If the patient converts to another rhythm, refer to the appropriate protocol and treat accordingly.
* If the patient relapses back into wide complex tachycardia / ventricular tachycardia, initiate synchronized cardioversion with the joules setting that previously cardioverted the patient.
* Record 3/4-lead EKG strips during medication administration.
* Perform a Diagnostic EKG prior to and after medication administration, or synchronized cardioversion of wide complex tachycardia / ventricular tachycardia.
* Perform a code summary and attach it to the patient run report.
* Be sure to treat the patient and not the monitor.

## Other Information
* Transport to appropriate facility.
* Contact receiving facility.
* Consult Medical Control where indicated.
* Appropriate transfer of care.
* Allergies: Amiodarone (Cordarone).
* Past medical history / medications, diet, drugs.
* Pacemaker.
