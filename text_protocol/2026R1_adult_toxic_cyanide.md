# Toxic Inhalation / Ingestion: Cyanide

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Apply High Flow Oxygen
3. Identify Cyanide Ingestion or Inhalation
    1. Immediately remove from continued exposure
    2. Avoid exertion to limit tissue oxygen demand
    3. Determine exposure time
4. Cardiac Monitoring Procedure
5. IV / IO Procedure
    1. To maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 if MAP unavailable or radial pulses
    2. Place 2 IV’s
    3. Draw blood sample if considering / supplied with hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit)
6. Capnography Procedure
7. Pulse Oximetry
8. Pulse Co-Oximetry (if available)
9. Hydroxocobalamin if supplied/available
    1. Reconstitute medication with 200 ml of normal saline (or to fill line)
    2. Mix thoroughly but do not shake
    3. 5 grams IV drip SLOW over 15–20 minutes
    4. Monitor for hypotension
10. Epinephrine Push Dose
    1. Make 10 mcg/ml
    2. 10 mcg (1 ml) prn – slow push
    3. Titrate to effect
    4. To maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 if MAP unavailable or radial pulses
    5. May use up to 50 mcg (5 ml) per dose if needed
11. Secure airway if comatose or compromised airway (follow Airway Protocol)

### Transport and Communication
1. Transport to appropriate facility
2. Contact receiving facility
3. Consult Medical Control where indicated
4. Appropriate transfer of care

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Skin, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremities, Neuro
* Cyanide is generally considered to be a rare source of poisoning.
* Cyanide exposure occurs relatively frequently in patients with smoke inhalation from fires.
* Numerous forms of cyanide exist, including gaseous hydrogen cyanide (HCN), water-soluble potassium and sodium cyanide salts, and poorly water-soluble mercury, copper, gold, and silver cyanide salts.
* Several synthesized (polyacrylonitrile, polyurethane, polyamide, urea-formaldehyde, melamine) and natural (wool, silk) compounds produce HCN when burned.
* Industry widely uses nitriles as solvents and in the manufacturing of plastics. Nitriles may release HCN during burning or when metabolized following absorption by the skin or gastrointestinal tract.
* Cyanide poisoning also may occur in other industries, particularly in the metal trades, mining, electroplating, jewelry manufacturing, and x-ray film recovery.
* Depending on its form, cyanide may cause toxicity through parenteral administration, inhalation, ingestion, or dermal absorption.
* Rapid aggressive therapy, consisting of supportive care and antidote administration, is lifesaving.
* The delay between exposure and onset of symptoms depends on type of cyanide involved, route of entry, and dose.
* Rapidity of symptom onset, depending on the type of cyanide exposure, occurs in the following order (most rapid to least rapid): gas, soluble salt, insoluble salt, and cyanogens.

## Other Information
**Potential Exposures**
* Smoke inhalation
* Intentional or unintentional poisoning or ingestion of Laetrile (vitamin B17) or multiple fruit pits
* Industrial exposure such as metal plating and recovery, plastics, industrial uses of hydrogen cyanide, or medical complications from the use of sodium nitroprusside

**Additional Notes**
* Aggressive airway management with delivery of 100% oxygen can be lifesaving.
* Supportive care with administration of oxygen alone has proven effective in a number of poisonings. It can also treat potential simultaneous CO exposure.
