# Hypertensive Emergencies

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. IV / IO PROTOCOL
3. TRANSPORT
    1. Head Up > 30 Degrees Position
    2. Assess Neuro Status – Record and Trend GCS
    3. Stroke Exam
    4. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
    5. CONTACT receiving facility
    6. APPROPRIATE transfer of care
4. Consult Online Medical Control  
    1. If EMS Needs Consideration of Other Interventions on a Per Case Basis
    2. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
5. Consider Potential Causes  
    1. Head Trauma (Cushing’s Reflex) – See Head Trauma Protocol
    2. Aortic Dissection – Supportive Care / Pain Management
    3. Pre-Eclampsia / Eclampsia – See OB Emergencies
    4. Sympathomimetics (Cocaine, Amphetamines, Etc.) – See Toxic Ingestion / Exposure / Overdose
    5. Discontinuation / Non–Compliance with Anti-Hypertensive Medications – Supportive Care
6. DIAGNOSTIC EKG PROCEDURE
    1. 1ST Contact to EKG and Transmission < 10 Min
7. BLOOD GLUCOSE PROCEDURE
8. If concurrent Chest Pain – Refer to ACS Protocol
9. If concurrent Pulmonary Edema – Treat Per CHF / Pulmonary Edema Protocol

### Consider Potential Causes
Describe the associated protocol for each possible cause listed:
1. Head Trauma (Cushing’s Reflex) – See Head Trauma Protocol
2. Aortic Dissection – Supportive Care / Pain Management
3. Pre-Eclampsia / Eclampsia – See OB Emergencies
4. Sympathomimetics (Cocaine, Amphetamines, Etc.) – See Toxic Ingestion / Exposure / Overdose
5. Discontinuation / Non–Compliance with Anti-Hypertensive Medications – Supportive Care

## Indications
* Documented hypertension
* Related diseases: diabetes, CVA, renal failure, cardiac
* Medications (compliance?)
* Pregnancy

## Signs and Symptoms
* Systolic BP 220 or greater
* Diastolic BP 120 or greater

AND at least one of these:
* Headache
* Nosebleed
* Blurred vision
* Dizziness

## Differential Diagnosis
* Hypertensive encephalopathy
* Primary CNS injury (Cushing's response = bradycardia with hypertension)
* Myocardial infarction
* Aortic dissection
* Pre-eclampsia / Eclampsia
* Sympathomimetic ingestion (cocaine)

## Key Points
* Prehospital treatment of hypertension is very conservative because a CVA in progress may be made worse by a drop in B/P following aggressive hypertension treatment.
* Consider treatment ONLY if patient has signs and symptoms of CHF or cardiac chest pain!
* Hypertensive emergencies are life-threatening emergencies characterized by an acute elevation in blood pressure AND end-organ damage to the cardiac, CNS, or renal systems. These crisis situations may occur when patients have poorly controlled chronic hypertension.
* All symptomatic patients with hypertension should be transported with their head elevated.
* Evidence of neurological deficit includes confusion, slurred speech, facial asymmetry, focal weakness, coma, lethargy, and seizure activity.
* Evidence of cardiac impairment includes angina, jugular vein distention, chest discomfort, and pulmonary edema.
* Toxic ingestion such as cocaine may present with a hypertensive emergency.
* Hypertension can be a neuroprotective reflex in patients with increased intracranial pressure.
