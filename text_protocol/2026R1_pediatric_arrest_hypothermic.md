# Hypothermic Cardiac Arrest (Pediatric Protocol)

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Ventilate half standard rate 10-15 breaths / min
3. Patient Assessment
    1. Attach Cardiac Monitor
    2. Apply Defibrillator / AED as soon as available
    3. If rectal temp is < 30 degrees C (86 degrees F):
        - Begin CPR Immediately
    4. If patient rectal temp is > 30 degrees C (86 degrees F):
        - Follow Standard Cardiac Arrest Protocols
    5. Deliver Shock x1 if Shockable
        - Limit to single attempt until warmed
        - Use highest available Joule setting
    6. Warm during arrest:
        - Remove wet clothing if applicable, dry and cover patient
        - Move to warmed area, increase ambient heat
        - Apply heat packs to groin, axilla, and neck
        - Consider warmed IV fluids if available

### Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC)
Criteria: At any time return of spontaneous circulation is achieved.
1. Continue Warming
2. Go to Post Resuscitation Cardiac Care Protocol

### Medication and Special Considerations
1. Withhold cardioactive medications until temp > 30 degrees C (86 degrees F)
2. May give dextrose products
3. Identify known dialysis patients in asystole, V-Fib, or pulseless V-Tach

### Special Transport Considerations
Criteria: If patient may benefit from ECMO.
1. Consider transport direct to a center capable of emergent ECMO
    - It is better to transport to a center than can do emergent ECMO even if it is much further away.
    - All ECPR centers can place patients on ECMO for hypothermia, but some non-ECPR centers can also.
    - Call medical control to discuss.

### Transport, Contact, and Transfer
1. Transport to appropriate facility
2. Contact receiving facility
3. Consult Medical Control where indicated
4. Appropriate transfer of care

## Indications
* Patient is believed to be in cardiac arrest due to hypothermia

## Signs and Symptoms
* Unresponsive
* Apneic
* Pulseless
* V-fib vs. pulseless V-tach
* Asystole
* Pulseless electrical activity (PEA)
* Medical vs. trauma

## Differential Diagnosis
* Medical vs. trauma
* V-fib vs. pulseless V-tach
* Asystole
* Pulseless electrical activity (PEA)

## Key Points
* If the temperature is unable to be measured, treat the patient based on the suspected temperature.
* Hypothermia may produce severe bradycardia.
* Shivering stops below 90° F (32° C).
* Hot packs can be activated and placed in the armpit and groin area if available.
* Care should be taken not to place the packs directly against the patient's skin.
* Consider withholding CPR if patient has organized rhythm. Discuss with Online Medical Control.
* Patients with low core temperatures may not respond to ALS drug interventions. Discuss ACLS drug use with Online Medical Control in severely hypothermic patients.
* Maintain warming procedure and supportive care. Warming procedures includes removing wet clothing, limiting exposure, and covering the patient with warm blankets if available.
* The most common mechanism of death in hypothermia is ventricular fibrillation. If the hypothermia victim is in ventricular fibrillation, CPR should be initiated. If V-FIB is not present, then all treatment and transport decisions should be tempered by the fact that V-FIB can be caused by rough handling, noxious stimuli, or even minor mechanical disturbances, this means that respiratory support with 100% oxygen should be done gently, including intubation, avoiding hyperventilation.
* The heart is most likely to fibrillate between 85 - 88° F (29 - 31° C). Defibrillate VF / VT x1 if no change, perform CPR and defer repeat defibrillation attempts until patient has been rewarmed.
