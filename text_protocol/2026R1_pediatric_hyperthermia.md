# Hyperthermia / Heat Exposure (Pediatric Protocol)

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol  
   * Document Patient Temperature  
   * Remove Patient from Heat Source  
   * Remove Patient Clothing  
   * Increase Air Flow around patient  
   * Monitor and Reassess  
   * Transport to appropriate facility  
   * Contact receiving facility  
   * Consult Medical Control where indicated  
   * Appropriate transfer of care

2. Capnography Procedure  
   * Cardiac Monitor / Diagnostic EKG Procedure  
   * Blood Glucose Procedure

3. Continue with further steps as necessary  
    1. If signs of heat exhaustion (NO AMS) or heat stroke (+AMS), follow appropriate sub-procedure  
    2. Apply coldest water available or ice water if possible  
    3. Apply ice packs to patient (Groin, Axilla, and Posterior neck)  
    4. Consider Cooling Collar  
    5. If available, consider immersion (submerge up to neck, agitate water, keep for 10–20 mins or return of normal mental status or core temp <102°F (40°C) if continuous core temp monitoring device available)  
    6. If mental status fails to return to normal after 20 mins, look for other causes and/or contact Medical Control  
    7. Do not interrupt submersion cooling for vomiting, bowel movement, combativeness, or seizures

### Heat Exhaustion (NO AMS)
Criteria: Patient with heat exposure but **NO altered mental status (AMS)**.
1. Apply coldest water available or ice water if possible.
2. Apply ice packs to patient (Groin, Axilla, Posterior neck).
3. Consider Cooling Collar.
4. IV / IO Procedure
    * If hypotensive: IV Normal Saline Bolus 20 ml/kg
    * If normotensive: IV Normal Saline TKO
    * Chilled saline if available.

### Heat Stroke (+AMS)
Criteria: Patient with heat exposure **AND** altered mental status (AMS).
#### Immersion Available:
1. Cold Water / Ice Immersion (can be prepared in 5 mins with any local assets/supplies)
    * Submerge as far up to neck as possible—keep head above water with towel/sheet under arms.
    * Agitate the water.
    * Keep immersed for 10–20 mins or until return of normal mental status or core temp <102°F (40°C) if purpose made continuous core temp monitoring device available.
    * If mental status fails to return to normal after 20 mins, look for other causes and/or contact Medical Control.
    * Providers may use purpose made continuous core body temperature monitoring devices if already in place or provided. Regular spot check thermometers are insufficient.
    * If continuous core temp device unavailable, use mental status as indicator to remove from cooling.
    * Do not interrupt submersion for vomiting, bowel movement, combativeness, or seizures.
    * Transport with early notification to hospital to begin preparing ice bath/cooling measures as needed.
    * If immersion cooling has started prior to EMS arrival, do not interrupt cooling for assessment/treatment until completed per protocol.

#### Immersion Unavailable:
1. Apply coldest water available or ice water if possible.
2. Apply ice packs to patient (Groin, Axilla, Posterior neck).
3. Consider Cooling Collar.
4. IV / IO Procedure
    * If hypotensive: IV Normal Saline Bolus 20 ml/kg
    * If normotensive: IV Normal Saline TKO
    * Chilled saline if available.
5. If significant hyperthermia (temp >104°F), begin active cooling as described above.

## Indications
* Pediatric patient with suspected or confirmed hyperthermia or heat exposure.

## Signs and Symptoms
* Fatigue and/or muscle cramping
* Altered mental status or unconsciousness
* Hot, dry, or sweaty skin
* Hypotension or shock
* Seizures
* Nausea
* Muscular/abdominal cramping
* General weakness
* Diaphoresis
* Febrile
* Confusion
* Dry mouth/thirsty
* Tachycardia
* BP normal or orthostatic hypotension
* Bizarre behavior
* Skin hot dry, febrile
* Seizure
* Coma

## Differential Diagnosis
* Fever (infection)
* Dehydration
* Medications
* Hyperthyroidism (storm)
* Delirium tremens (DT's)
* Heat cramps
* Heat exhaustion
* Heat stroke
* CNS lesions or tumors

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Skin, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Neuro
* Patients at risk for heat emergencies include neonates, infants, geriatric patients, and patients with mental illness. Other contributory factors may include heart medications, diuretics, cold medications, tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, anticholinergic medications, and alcohol.
* Cocaine, amphetamines, and salicylates may elevate body temperatures.
* Heat exposure can occur due to increased environmental temperatures, prolonged exercise, or both.
* Environments with temperature >90°F and humidity >60% present the most risk.
* Sweating generally disappears as body temperature rises.
* Heat Cramps: Benign muscle cramping secondary to dehydration, not associated with elevated temperature.
* Heat Exhaustion: Dehydration, salt depletion, dizziness, fever, headache, cramping, nausea, vomiting. VS: tachycardia, hypotension, elevated temperature.
* Heat Stroke: Dehydration, tachycardia, hypotension, elevated temperature, altered mental status. Requires cooling.
* On scene cooling by submersion in ice water for heat stroke is imperative. Prepare and submerge patient if a suitable tub, ice, and water are available or can be set up in less than the transport time to the hospital or 5 mins.
* Hospitals are unlikely to have immediate availability of an ice bath—utilize available resources ASAP to prevent deterioration.
* A body bag with ice and water can be used as a makeshift tub if necessary or during transport if additional cooling is required.
* Agitating the water improves convection and cooling.
* Shivering may occur as patient is cooled. Do not discontinue cooling until mental status or target core temperature is achieved.
* Heat stroke occurs when the cooling mechanism of the body (sweating) ceases due to temperature overload and/or electrolyte imbalances. Be alert for cardiac dysrhythmias.
* In significant hyperthermia (temp >104°F), begin active cooling with natural or chemical ice packs applied to groin, axilla, and back of neck if submersion is unavailable.
* Use best cooling options available prior to transport when feasible; cool patient before transport.

## Other Information
* Providers may use purpose made continuous core body temperature monitoring devices if provided. Regular spot check thermometers are insufficient.
* Use mental status to determine when to remove from cooling if continuous core temp monitoring device is unavailable.
* If immersion cooling has been initiated by on scene providers prior to EMS arrival, do not interrupt cooling for assessment or treatment until the cooling period has completed per this protocol.
* Do not interrupt submersion cooling for vomiting, bowel movement, combativeness, or seizures.
