# BURNS

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. Consider SPINAL MOTION RESTRICTION PROCEDURE
3. OXYGEN
4. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
5. AIRWAY PROTOCOL
6. If chest, neck, face, airway involvement – Prepare for invasive airway procedures:
    1. INTUBATION - only if evidence of airway compromise
    2. CRICOTHYROTOMY - NEEDLE, KIT, or SURGICAL as provided and trained; in rare circumstances for life saving measures only
7. Remove clothing and/or expose area
8. Remove rings, bracelets, and other constricting items
9. Patient Assessment:
    1. If burn < 10% body surface area (using rule of nines)
        - Cool down wound with NORMAL SALINE
        - Cover burn with dry sterile sheet or dressings
        - PAIN MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL
    2. Eye Injury
        - Continuous flushing with Normal Saline
        - Cover burn with dry sterile sheet or dressings
    3. If burns > 20% then IV/IO PROCEDURE:
        - 80 drops/min (Macrodrip set)
        - Do not exceed 500 ml/hr – otherwise KVO
10. If chemical burn:
    1. Flush area with NORMAL SALINE for 10–15 minutes
11. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
12. CONTACT receiving facility
13. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
14. APPROPRIATE transfer of care
15. Initiate Trauma Alert

### Thermal Burns Procedure
* Treat according to % and seriousness of burn:
    1. Stop burning process: remove patient from heat source, cool skin, remove clothing
    2. If patient starts to shiver or skin is cool, stop cooling process
    3. Estimate extent (%) and depth of burn (see Rule of 9’s chart)
    4. Cover burn areas with sterile dressing
    5. If >10% body surface area, never apply ice or cool further

### Chemical Burns Procedure
* Decontamination priority:
    1. Wear appropriate protective clothing and respirators
    2. Remove patient from contaminated area to decontamination site (not squad)
    3. Determine chemicals involved; contact appropriate agency
    4. Remove patient’s clothing and flush skin
    5. Leave contaminated clothes at scene; cover patient over and under before loading
    6. Patient should be transported by personnel not involved in decontamination
    7. Relay type of substance involved to Medical Control

### Radiation Burns Procedure
* Treat as thermal burn unless contaminated with radioactive source:
    1. Treat as chemical burn if contaminated
    2. Wear protective clothing when dealing with contamination
    3. Contact HAZ MAT TEAM for assistance

### Electrical Burns Procedure
1. Shut down electrical source; do not attempt to remove patient until electricity is confirmed shut off
2. Assess for visible entrance/exit wounds and treat as thermal burns
3. Assess for internal injury, vascular damage, tissue damage, fractures; treat accordingly

### Inhalation Burns Procedure
1. Suspect with burns to face/neck, singed nasal hairs, cough/stridor, soot in sputum, or closed smoky environment
2. Provide oxygen therapy
3. Contact Medical Control and transport
4. Initiate early intubation for symptomatic patients

## Indications
* Type of exposure (heat, gas, chemical)
* Inhalation injury
* Time of injury
* Past medical history
* Medications
* Other trauma
* Loss of consciousness
* Tetanus/immunization status

## Signs and Symptoms
* Burns, pain, swelling
* Dizziness
* Loss of consciousness
* Hypotension/shock
* Airway compromise/distress
* Singed facial or nasal hair
* Hoarseness/wheezing
* Superficial (1°) red and painful
* Partial thickness (2°): superficial partial thickness, deep partial thickness, blistering
* Full thickness (3°): painless and charred or leathery skin

## Differential Diagnosis
* Chemical
* Thermal
* Electrical
* Radiation

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, HEENT, Neck, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremities, Back, Neuro
* Intubation is only required in cases with airway compromise.
* Critical Burns: >25% body surface area (BSA); full thickness burns >10% BSA; partial thickness (superficial partial thickness, deep partial thickness and full thickness burns) to face, eyes, hand or feet; electrical burns; respiratory burns; deep chemical burns; burns with extremes of age or chronic disease; and burns with associated major traumatic injury. These burns may require hospital admission or transfer to a burn center.
* Potential CO exposure should be treated with 100% oxygen.
* Circumferential burns to extremities are dangerous due to potential vascular compromise partial thickness to soft tissue swelling.
* Burn patients are prone to hypothermia – Never apply ice or cool burns that involve >10% body surface area.
* Do not overlook the possibility of multiple system trauma.
* Do not overlook the possibility of child abuse with children and burn injuries.
* See appendix for rule of nines.
* Handle patients gently to avoid further damage of the patient’s skin.
* If the patient is exposed to a chemical, whenever possible, get the name of the chemical and document it on the patient run report. DO NOT transport any hazardous materials with the patient.
* Look for signs of dehydration and shock.
* Initiate early intubation for symptomatic patients with inhalation burns.
* Patients with major burns should be transported to a Regional Burn Center.
* Patients with unstable airway or who are rapidly deteriorating should be transported to the closest appropriate facility.
* Patients with large surface burns lose the ability to regulate their body temperature. Avoid heat loss by covering the patient.

## Other Information
* See Rule of 9’s chart at the end of this section.
