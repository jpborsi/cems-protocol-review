# Abdominal Trauma

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. AIRWAY PROTOCOL
3. CONSIDER SPINAL MOTION RESTRICTION PROCEDURE
4. Determine if Load & Go
5. BLEEDING / HEMORRHAGE CONTROL PROCEDURE
    1. Evisceration: Cover, clean saline dressing to loosely stabilize
    2. Penetrating Object: Cover, clean saline dressing – Immobilize object. If too large to transport – attempt to cut with care not to further injure tissue
    3. Penetrating Wounds: Cover, clean saline dressing. Look for exit wound
6. Monitor and Reassess
7. INITIATE TRAUMA ALERT
8. IV / IO PROCEDURE
    1. To Maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 (100 systolic if >70 years old) if MAP Unavailable or Radial Pulses
9. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
10. CONTACT receiving facility
11. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
12. APPROPRIATE transfer of care
13. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
14. OXYGEN

### Hemorrhage Control and Specific Injury Care
1. If evidence of current / previous uncontrolled hemorrhage, HR > 120 and / or SBP < 90, within 60 mins of injury:
    1. Consider TRANEXAMIC ACID (TXA)
    2. 2 Grams (2000 mg) IV / IO slow push over 10 min –or–
    3. 2 Grams IV / IO (2000 mg) mixed in 100 ml D5W over 10 mins

### Blunt Trauma Assessment
1. Assess for change – distention.
2. Note mechanism

## Indications
* Blunt trauma 
* Penetrating trauma

## Signs and Symptoms
* Altered mental status
* Shock
* Distention
* Swelling
* Bulging
* Nausea and vomiting
* Bleeding
* Tenderness
* Pain
* Evisceration
* Discoloration
* Entrance / exit wounds

## Differential Diagnosis
* Not specified in the protocol

## Key Points
* Trauma to the abdomen is either Blunt or Penetrating. Blunt injuries are harder to detect and diagnose, and have a death rate twice that of penetrating wounds. Key signs and symptoms of blunt trauma include a patient in shock with no obvious injuries. Distention of the abdomen is an indication of internal hemorrhage. Pain may not be a significant factor. Many abdominal trauma injuries are Load & Go cases.
* Look for both an entrance and exit wound for all penetrating trauma, and treat accordingly.
* For all major trauma patients, the on scene time should be less than ten minutes.
* Pelvic pain with hypotension or tachycardia should have a pelvic binder placed.

## Other Information
* Multiple Trauma Protocol if criteria
