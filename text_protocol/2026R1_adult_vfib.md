# Ventricular Fibrillation / Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Begin CPR Immediately
3. Apply Cardiac Monitor
4. Defibrillator / AED – Confirm V-Fib / VTach
5. Give ONE Antiarrhythmic during CPR
6. Defibrillate 360 J or Device Recommendation
7. Immediately Resume CPR / 2 minutes
8. IV / IO Procedure
9. Reassess Rhythm
10. Defibrillate 300 J or Device Recommendation
11. Immediately Resume CPR / 2 minutes
12. Reassess Rhythm
13. Defibrillate 200 J or Device Recommendation
14. Immediately Resume CPR / 2 minutes
15. Continue cycles as above

    1. Consider Field Termination of Resuscitative Efforts
    2. If patient awakens during CPR or CPR device use, despite a non-life sustaining rhythm that interferes with treatment, consider one of the following medications:
        - KETAMINE
        - FENTANYL
        - MIDAZOLAM
        - LORAZEPAM
        - Use usual adult dosing
        - Repeat as needed to yield patient response permitting resuscitation

16. If any time Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC), go to Post Resuscitation Cardiac Care

### Special Circumstances Pathways

#### Dialysis/Hyperkalemia Patient Pathway
If known dialysis patient or history concerning for hyperkalemia:
1. Flush IV Line Then
    - CALCIUM GLUCONATE 3 Grams SLOW IV / IO 
    - OR CALCIUM CHLORIDE 1 Gram SLOW IV / IO 
        - q 5 minutes prn if available
        - DO NOT MIX WITH SODIUM BICARBONATE IN SAME LINE
2. Flush IV Line Then
    - SODIUM BICARBONATE 1 mEq / kg up to 200 mEq IV / IO

#### In Case of DNR
1. Review DNR Comfort Care Guidelines
2. Contact Online Medical Control
3. Criteria for DNR

#### If Amiodarone Unavailable
1. See Medication Section for Lidocaine

### Medication Administration

- AMIODARONE 300 mg IV / IO
    - May repeat @ 150 mg IV / IO in 3 - 5 minutes – Max 450 mg
- If Amiodarone Unavailable, see Medication Section for Lidocaine

- CONSIDER MAGNESIUM SULFATE 2 grams over 1 - 2 minutes IV / IO (Torsades, Alcoholism, Malnutrition ONLY)
    - May repeat 2 gram dose up to max 4 grams

- EPINEPHrine 1 mg IV / IO of 0.1 mg / ml q 3 - 5 minutes

#### Airway Protocol
1. Follow Airway Protocol as needed

#### Capnography
1. Capnography Procedure

#### Transport
1. Transport to appropriate facility
2. Contact receiving facility
3. Consult Medical Control where indicated
4. Appropriate transfer of care

- If criteria for death, refer to DOA Guidelines and contact Online Medical Control

## Indications
* Unresponsive, apneic, pulseless patient
* Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia on ECG

## Signs and Symptoms
* Unresponsive, apneic, pulseless
* Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia on ECG

## Differential Diagnosis
* Asystole
* Artifact / device failure
* Cardiac
* Endocrine / metabolic
* Drugs
* Pulmonary embolus

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status
* Always minimize interruptions to chest compressions.
* When IV access failed or difficult, humeral head IO are preferred routes over tibial IO for resuscitation.
* Effective CPR should be as continuous as possible with a minimum of 5 cycles or 2 minutes.
* Reassess and document endotracheal tube placement and Capnography frequently, after every move, and at discharge.
* Polymorphic V-Tach (Torsades de Pointes) may benefit from administration of Magnesium Sulfate.
* If the patient converts to another rhythm, or has a return of circulation, refer to the appropriate protocol and treat accordingly.
* If the patient converts back to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia after being converted to ANY other rhythm, defibrillate at the previous setting used.
* Defibrillation following effective CPR is the definitive therapy for ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Magnesium Sulfate should be administered early in the arrest if hypomagnesemia (chronic alcoholic or malnourished patients) is suspected.
* If patient is pregnant and in cardiac arrest, manually manipulate the uterus to the left during CPR.
* Zoll and Phillips equivalency settings are 120, 150, 200 Joules to Physio Control / Stryker 200, 300, 360 Joules. If unsure about settings use highest joule setting per AHA.
* Damage to defibrillators during double sequential defibrillation may not be covered by manufacturers, use the technique with prior approval from your department.
* Do not delay transport or make stops to obtain a second defibrillator to accomplish double sequential defibrillation. This is only for situations where two are already on scene. The defibrillators do not have to be of the same make / model.
* Dextrose should only be administered to a patient with a confirmed blood glucose level less than 70 mg / dl.
* If shockable rhythm and in an area with eCPR (ECMO CPR) capability at the receiving hospital, those eCPR guidelines for resuscitation and abbreviated field treatment may be followed. This requires specific training and education for the EMS agencies in the catchment area where these programs are being conducted.

## Other Information

* Estimated down time
* Past medical history
* Medications
* Events leading to arrest
* Renal failure / dialysis
* DNR

* Strongly encourage transport of resuscitated patient to facility with PCI where available.
