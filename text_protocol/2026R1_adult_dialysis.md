# Dialysis / Renal Patient

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Diagnostic EKG Procedure
    1. 1st Contact to EKG and Transmission < 10 Min
3. Airway Protocol
4. IV / IO Procedure
5. Capnography Procedure
6. Patient Assessment and Immediate Interventions
    1. **Breathing Difficulty**
        - Treat per RESPIRATORY DISTRESS Protocol or CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE Protocol based on lung findings.
    2. **Bleeding Catheter / Shunt**
        - Apply Pressure Over Site / Pressure Points
        - Apply Tourniquet if risk of Exsanguination (Above and Below Site - Not over Shunt)
        - Hemostatic Agents may be considered in CHEST and GROIN ACCESS ONLY
    3. **Symptomatic HYPERtension**
        - Blurred Vision, Headache, Diaphoresis
        - DISCUSS each case with Online Medical Control after STROKE ASSESSMENT
    4. **Missed Dialysis with Cardiac Changes**
        - Treat per HYPERKALEMIA Protocol
    5. **Symptomatic HYPOtension**
        - Pre-Dialysis: Consider Septic Shock / Cardiogenic Shock
        - Post Dialysis: Consider Volume Depletion
        - Treat Per Appropriate Shock Protocol
        - CONSIDER ITD PROCEDURE
            - NO ITD if Cardiogenic Shock
    6. **Chest Pain**
        - Treat with ACUTE CORONARY SYMPTOMS Protocol
7. Transport to appropriate facility
8. Contact receiving facility
9. Consult Medical Control where indicated
10. Appropriate transfer of care

### Breathing Difficulty Protocol
Criteria: Patient presents with breathing difficulty.

1. Treat per RESPIRATORY DISTRESS Protocol or
2. Treat per CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE Protocol based on lung findings.

### Bleeding Catheter / Shunt Protocol
Criteria: Patient is bleeding from a catheter or shunt.

1. Apply Pressure Over Site / Pressure Points.
2. If risk of exsanguination, apply tourniquet above and below site (not over shunt).
3. Hemostatic Agents may be considered in CHEST and GROIN ACCESS ONLY.

### Symptomatic HYPERtension Protocol
Criteria: Patient has symptomatic hypertension (Blurred Vision, Headache, Diaphoresis).

1. Discuss each case with Online Medical Control after STROKE ASSESSMENT.

### Missed Dialysis with Cardiac Changes Protocol
Criteria: Patient missed dialysis and has cardiac changes.

1. Treat per HYPERKALEMIA Protocol.

### Symptomatic HYPOtension Protocol
Criteria: Patient is hypotensive.

1. Pre-Dialysis: Consider Septic Shock or Cardiogenic Shock.
2. Post Dialysis: Consider Volume Depletion.
3. Treat per appropriate Shock Protocol.
4. Consider ITD Procedure.
    - NO ITD if Cardiogenic Shock.

### Chest Pain Protocol
Criteria: Patient presents with chest pain.

1. Treat with ACUTE CORONARY SYMPTOMS Protocol.

## Indications
* Renal failure
* Dialysis treatment
* Anemia
* Dialysis treatment schedule
* Previous implications
* Long term catheter access
* Shunt access

## Signs and Symptoms
* Hyperkalemia
* Hypotension
* Bleeding
* Fever
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Altered mental status
* Seizure
* Dysrhythmias

## Differential Diagnosis
* Congestive heart failure
* Pericarditis
* Diabetic problem

## Key Points
* The chronic renal dialysis patient has numerous medical problems. The kidneys help maintain electrolyte balance, acid-base balance and rid the body of metabolic waste. Kidney failure results in a build-up of toxins within the body, which can cause many problems.
* Dialysis is a process which filters out the toxins, excess fluids and restores electrolyte balance.
* The process may be done in two ways:
    1. **Peritoneal Dialysis**: Toxins are absorbed by osmosis through a solution infused into the peritoneal cavity and then drained out. The solution is placed into the abdomen by means of a catheter, which is placed below the navel. This process must be done frequently, as frequently as every 12 hours for a period of 1 - 2 hours.
    2. **Hemodialysis**: Removes toxins by directly filtering the blood using equipment that functions like an electric kidney, circulating the blood through a Shunt that is connected to a vein and an artery. This process usually needs to be done every 2 - 3 days for a period of 3 - 5 hours. A permanent shunt can be surgically formed as a fistula.
* Do not take blood pressure in arm that has the active shunt.
* A renal patient in full cardiac arrest should be treated according to current ACLS guidelines.

## Other Information

### Possible Complications of Dialysis Treatment

1. **Hypotension (15-30%)**
    - May result in angina, MI, dysrhythmia, altered mental status, and seizure
2. **Removal of therapeutic medications**
    - Example: Tegretol
3. **Disequilibrium syndrome**
    - Cause: shift of urea and/or electrolytes
    - Signs and symptoms: Nausea and/or vomiting, altered mentation, or seizure
4. **Bleeding**
    - These patients are often treated with heparin and they may have a low platelet count
    - Bleeding may be at the catheter site, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, or subdural
5. **Equipment malfunctions**
    - Possible air embolus
    - Possible fever or endotoxin
