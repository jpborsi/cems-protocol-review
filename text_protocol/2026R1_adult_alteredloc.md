Criteria: If evidence of hypo- or hyperglycemia.
1. Treat per Diabetic Protocol.

### Head Trauma Protocol
Criteria: If evidence of head trauma.

## Indications
* Altered mental status
* Known diabetic, medic alert tag
* Drugs, drug paraphernalia present
* Report of illicit drug use or toxic ingestion
* Past medical history
* Medications
* History of trauma

## Signs and Symptoms
* Decreased mental status
* Change in baseline mental status
* Bizarre behavior
* Hypoglycemia (cool, diaphoretic skin)
* Hyperglycemia (warm, dry skin; fruity breath; Kussmaul respirations; signs of dehydration)

## Differential Diagnosis
* Head trauma
* CNS (stroke, tumor, seizure, infection)
* Cardiac (MI, CHF)
* Infection
* Thyroid (hyper/hypo)
* Shock (septic, metabolic, traumatic)
* Diabetes (hyper/hypoglycemia)
* Toxicological incident
* Acidosis/alkalosis
* Environmental exposure
* Pulmonary (hypoxia)
* Electrolyte abnormality
* Psychiatric disorder

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, HEENT, Skin, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Back, Extremities, Neuro
* Be aware of AMS as potential sign of an environmental toxin or Haz-Mat exposure and protect personal safety.
* It is safer to assume hypoglycemia than hyperglycemia if doubt exists.
* Do not let alcohol confuse the clinical picture. Alcoholics frequently develop hypoglycemia and need Thiamine before glucose.
* Low glucose (< 70), normal glucose (70 - 120), high glucose (> 250).
* Consider restraints if necessary for patient's and / or personnel's protection per the restraint procedure.
* Protect the patient airway and support ABCs.
* Document the patient’s Glasgow coma score pre-and post-treatment.
* Signs and symptoms of narcotic overdose include respiratory depression and altered mental status.
* Naloxone administration may cause the patient to go into acute opiate withdraw, which includes vomiting, agitation, and / or combative behavior. Always be prepared for combative behavior.
* Naloxone may wear off in as little as 20 minutes causing the patient to become more sedate and possibly hypoventilate. All A&O 4 patients having received Naloxone should be transported. If patient refuses transport, contact Online Medical Control before release.

## Other Information
* None.
