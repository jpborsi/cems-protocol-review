# FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO) - ADULT

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Head Tilt / Chin Lift / Jaw Thrust Airway Maneuvers
3. Encourage Patient to Cough
4. Continue with further steps as necessary
    1. If patient is coughing and conscious, encourage coughing and provide oxygen at 10–15 L NRB.
    2. If complete obstruction occurs in a conscious patient, perform abdominal thrusts (or chest thrusts/back blows as appropriate).
    3. If patient becomes unconscious or is unable to remove the obstruction, visualize and remove obvious obstructions.
    4. Attempt ventilation, reposition head and attempt again if unable to ventilate.
    5. If still unable to ventilate, continue the sequence of interventions:
        - Attempt removal with Magill forceps under direct laryngoscopy.
        - If obstruction cannot be removed, proceed with cricothyrotomy (needle, kit, or surgical), as provided and trained, with prior Medical Control training/approval.

### Conscious Patient – Coughing
- If the patient is conscious and able to cough, encourage coughing.
- Administer oxygen at 10–15 L NRB.

### Conscious Patient – Complete Obstruction
- If the patient is conscious but has a complete airway obstruction:
    1. Perform abdominal thrusts.
    2. For cases where abdominal thrusts are not appropriate, perform chest thrusts and/or back blows.

### Unconscious Patient or Unable to Remove Obstruction
- If the patient is unconscious or the obstruction has not been removed:
    1. Visualize airway and remove obvious obstructions.
    2. Attempt ventilation, reposition head and try again if unable to ventilate.
    3. Continue the sequence (removal with Magill forceps, cricothyrotomy).

### Transport and Contact Procedures
- TRANSPORT to appropriate facility.
- CONTACT receiving facility.
- CONSULT Medical Control where indicated.
- APPROPRIATE transfer of care.

## Indications
* Coughing
* Choking
* Inability to speak
* Unresponsive
* Witnessed aspiration

## Signs and Symptoms
* Sudden episode of choking
* Gagging
* Audible stridor
* Change in skin color
* Decreased level of consciousness
* Increased or decreased respiratory rate
* Labored breathing
* Unproductive cough

## Differential Diagnosis
* Cardiac arrest
* Respiratory arrest
* Anaphylaxis
* Esophageal obstruction

## Key Points
* With complete obstruction, positive-pressure ventilation may be successful.
* Needle cricothyrotomy will provide short term oxygenation only (not ventilation) and is used to “buy time” until other interventions can assure appropriate ventilation.
* Cricothyrotomy kits have a larger internal diameter than needle cric and thus will provide some minimal ventilation.
* Needle cricothyrotomy and cricothyrotomy kits are bridge devices to surgical intervention.
