# Behavioral / Psychiatric Emergencies

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Patient Assessment
    1. Exam: Mental Status, Skin, Heart, Lungs, Neuro
    2. All psychiatric patients must have medical clearance at a hospital ED before transport to a mental health facility.
3. Scene Safety
    1. Summon Law Enforcement as needed.
    2. Remove patient from stressful environment.
    3. Constant reassessment of ABC’s, personal, and patient safety.
4. Treat suspected problems per appropriate protocol:
    1. AMS (Altered Mental Status)
    2. Overdose
    3. Head Trauma
    4. Hypoglycemia
5. Blood Glucose Procedure
6. Transport to appropriate facility.
    1. Contact receiving facility.
    2. Consult Medical Control where indicated.
    3. Appropriately transfer care.

### Agitation – Not Combative
Patient is experiencing a period of high anxiety seemingly from a psychiatric event not otherwise treatable by EMS who is not a threat to self or others.

1. Verbal techniques (reassurance, calm, establish rapport)
2. Limit patient stimulation and use de-escalation techniques.

### Combative – Not Violent
Patient is a threat to self or others and can be controlled and restrained with appropriate help without significant risk to the providers.

Criteria for Restraint Use:
* Patient out of control and may cause harm to self or others.
* Necessary force required for patient control without causing harm.
* Position of patient must not impede airway or breathing.
* Restraints must not impede circulation.
* Place mask on patient for body secretion protection. May use surgical mask, or Non-rebreather if patient needs oxygen.
* Use supine or lateral positioning ONLY.
* MSP checks are required every 15 min.
* DOCUMENT methods used.
* Medication should be used in conjunction with physical restraint when available.

Criteria for medication use for combative / violent patients:
* Patient out of control and may cause harm to self or others.
* Patient is NOT a medical patient (treat underlying causes).
* Medications can be given safely without harm to patient or EMS.
* Use minimum force required for patient control without causing harm.
* Position of patient must not impede airway or breathing.
* DOCUMENT methods used.

#### Medication Options
* MIDAZOLAM 0.05 - 0.1 mg/kg IV/IO q 5 min prn – Max Dose 2.5 mg
* or MIDAZOLAM 0.2 mg/kg IM/IN q 5 min prn – Max Dose 5 mg
* or LORazepam 0.05 – 0.1 mg/kg slow IV/IO/IN/IM q 10 min prn – Max Dose 2 mg

##### If Signs of Emergence After KETAMINE
* Administer MIDAZOLAM as above.
* Notify receiving physician Ketamine administered so patient presentation is not misconstrued as other etiology.
* Capnography procedure required.

### Combative – Violent
Patient is in a violent state that puts providers at significant risk despite appropriate help.

1. Restraint procedure (as above)
2. KETAMINE 2 mg/kg IM (use 100 mg/ml concentration)
    1. May repeat 1 mg/kg IM in 5 min if no response
    2. Max per dose 250 mg
3. If patient is hyperthermic, begin cooling with ice packs in groin and axilla.
4. Capnography procedure required.

### Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)
1. diphenhydrAMINE 1 mg/kg slow IV/IM/IO. No repeat – Max dose 50 mg.
2. Capnography procedure required.

### Emergence Symptoms
* Assess for: Confusion, Excitement, Irrational Behavior, Hallucinations, Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (Increased Body Temp > 38°C (100.4°F), Muscle Rigidity, Diaphoresis, Altered LOC).

## Indications
* Risk to self or others due to psychiatric or behavioral emergency.
* For use in psychosis only.
* NOT for medical emergencies such as hypoxemia, sepsis, seizure, encephalitis, hypoglycemia, or stroke.
* Significant threat to providers (combative – violent).

## Signs and Symptoms
* Situational crisis
* Psychiatric illness / medications
* Injury to self or threats to others
* Medic alert tag
* Substance abuse / overdose
* Diabetes
* Anxiety, agitation, confusion
* Affect change, hallucinations
* Delusional thoughts, bizarre behavior
* Combative violent
* Expression of suicidal / homicidal thoughts
* See Altered Mental Status differential diagnosis
* Agitated – Non-combative
* Combative – Not violent
* Combative – Violent
* Involuntary movements / Extrapyramidal symptoms: purposeless movements, tongue protrusion, rapid eye blinking, facial grimacing, lip smacking/puckering

## Differential Diagnosis
* Alcohol intoxication
* Toxin / substance abuse
* Medication effect / OD
* Withdrawal syndromes
* Depression
* Bipolar (manic-depressive)
* Schizophrenia
* Anxiety disorders
* Medical causes: head trauma, hypoglycemia, acute intoxication, sepsis, CNS insult, hypoxia

## Key Points
* Your safety first!!
* Constant reassessment of ABC’s, personal, and patient safety
* Be sure to consider all possible medical/trauma causes for behavior (Hypoglycemia, overdose, substance abuse, hypoxia, head injury, seizure, etc.)
* Do not irritate the patient with a prolonged exam.
* Do not overlook the possibility of associated domestic violence or child abuse.
* The safety of on scene personnel is the priority. Protect yourself and others by summoning law enforcement to assure everyone’s safety and if necessary, to enable you to render care. Do not approach the patient if he/she is armed with a weapon. Once restrained assure that the patient is searched for weapons.
* Ketamine use in pregnancy is a risk/benefit assessment per case. Consult Medical Control if there are questions.
* Limit patient stimulation and use de-escalation techniques.
* Handcuffs applied by law enforcement to patients NOT in custody/under arrest may be switched to soft restraints for transport.
* Handcuffs applied by law enforcement to patients IN custody/under arrest require a law enforcement officer to remain available to adjust restraints as necessary for the patient’s safety. This policy is not intended to negate the need for law enforcement personnel to use appropriate restraint equipment to establish scene control.
* Consider treatment of agitation/anxiety combativeness for patients requiring restraint procedure.
* Suicide ideation or attempts must be transported for evaluation.
* Transport to facilities with appropriate police/security.
* Be alert for rapidly changing behaviors.
