# ASYSTOLE / PULSELESS ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY (PEA) - PEDIATRIC PROTOCOL

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. Continuous CPR
3. Apply Cardiac Monitor
4. Confirm Asystole / PEA
5. IV / IO PROCEDURE
6. Identify Possible Causes
    1. Hypoxemia
    2. Acidosis
    3. Hypovolemia
    4. Tension Pneumothorax
    5. Hypothermia
7. PEDIATRIC AIRWAY PROTOCOL
8. EPINEPHrine 0.01 mg/kg IV/IO of 0.1 mg/ml Concentration
    1. Repeat every 3 - 5 minutes
    2. Max 1 mg per dose
    3. Double Check EPI Concentration
9. NORMAL SALINE IV BOLUS 20 ml/kg
    1. Repeat as needed
10. BLOOD GLUCOSE PROCEDURE
11. DEXTROSE 10% 5 ml/kg IV/IO max 250 ml
    1. If DEXTROSE 10% Is unavailable, see medication section for DEXTROSE 25% or 50%
12. Continuous CPR
13. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
14. CONTACT receiving facility
15. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
16. APPROPRIATE transfer of care

### Sub-Procedure: Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC)
**Criteria:** If Return of Spontaneous Circulation occurs at any time.
1. GO TO PEDIATRIC POST RESUSCITATION CARDIAC CARE PROTOCOL

## Indications
* Cardiac arrest in children (asystole or pulseless electrical activity)
* Patient without a pulse

## Signs and Symptoms
* Pulseless
* Apneic or agonal respirations
* Cyanosis

## Differential Diagnosis
* Ventricular fibrillation
* Pulseless ventricular tachycardia

### CONSIDER TREATABLE CAUSES
* Hypovolemia
* Tension pneumothorax
* Myocardial infarction
* Drug overdose
* Hypothermia
* Acidosis
* Cardiac tamponade
* Pulmonary embolism
* Tricyclic overdose
* Hypoxia
* Hypoglycemia
* Hyperkalemia

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status
* Always confirm asystole in more than one lead.
* Cardiac arrest in children is primarily due to lack of an adequate airway, resulting in hypoxia.
* If the patient converts to another rhythm or has a return of circulation, refer to the appropriate protocol and treat accordingly.
* When assessing for a pulse, palpate the brachial or femoral arteries for infants and the carotid or femoral artery for children.
* Continue BLS procedures throughout the resuscitation.
* If the patient is intubated, be sure to routinely reassess tube placement.
* If the patient has an IO, routinely reassess for patency.
* Consider atropine when evidence of increased vagal stimulation is present.

## Other Information

**Patient Weights/Heights Reference:**
* 3-5 kg (6-11 lbs, 18-24 in)
* 6-7 kg (13-15 lbs, 24-26 in)
* 8-9 kg (18-20 lbs, 26-29 in)
* 10-11 kg (22-24 lbs, 29-33 in)
* 12-14 kg (26-31 lbs, 33-38 in)
* 15-18 kg (33-40 lbs, 38-43 in)
* 19-23 kg (42-51 lbs, 43-48 in)
* 24-29 kg (53-64 lbs, 48-52 in)
* 30-36 kg (66-81 lbs, 52-57 in)

**If Dextrose 25% Not Available:**
* Draw 25 ml of Dextrose 50% out of syringe and dilute with additional 25 ml of normal saline

**Fluid Resuscitate to systolic of 70 + 2 x age**

**Do Not Confuse EPINEPhrine 1 mg/ml and 0.1 mg/ml**

**Blood Glucose**
* Glucose < 60

**History Considerations:**
* Time of arrest
* Medical history
* Medications
* Possibility of foreign body
* Hypothermia
