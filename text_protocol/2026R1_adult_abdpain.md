# Abdominal Pain

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Differentiate Flank Pain from Abdominal Pain and Treat per Pain Management Protocol
3. Continue with further steps as necessary:
    1. Consider Acute Coronary Syndrome Protocol
    2. IV Procedure - Normal Saline Bolus to maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 if MAP unavailable or radial pulses, if hypotensive
    3. Capnography Procedure
    4. Diagnostic EKG Procedure - 1st contact to EKG and transmission < 10 minutes
    5. Nausea and Vomiting Protocol
    6. Pain Management Protocol
    7. Transport to appropriate facility
    8. Contact receiving facility
    9. Consult Medical Control where indicated
    10. Appropriate transfer of care

### Universal Patient Care Protocol
Proceed with standard patient evaluation and stabilization per protocol guidelines.

### IV Procedure
If hypotensive:
1. Normal Saline Bolus to maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 if MAP unavailable or radial pulses.

### Capnography Procedure
Implement capnography as part of patient monitoring.

### Diagnostic EKG Procedure
1. Perform EKG.
2. Ensure 1st contact to EKG and transmission is < 10 minutes.

### Pain Management Protocol
Assess and treat pain according to pain management guidelines.

### Nausea and Vomiting Protocol
Assess and treat nausea and vomiting per protocol.

## Indications
* Patients presenting with abdominal pain.

## Signs and Symptoms
* Pain (location/migration)
* Tenderness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Dysuria
* Constipation
* Vaginal bleeding/discharge
* Pregnancy

Associated symptoms (helpful to localize source):
* Fever
* Headache
* Weakness
* Malaise
* Myalgias
* Cough
* Mental status changes
* Rash

## Differential Diagnosis
* Pneumonia or pulmonary embolus
* Liver (hepatitis, CHF)
* Peptic ulcer disease / gastritis
* Gallbladder
* Myocardial infarction
* Pancreatitis
* Kidney stone
* Abdominal aneurysm
* Appendicitis
* Bladder / prostate disorder
* Pelvic (PID, ectopic pregnancy, ovarian cyst)
* Spleen enlargement
* Diverticulitis
* Bowel obstruction
* Gastroenteritis (infectious)

## Key Points
* Required Exam: Mental Status, Skin, HEENT, Neck, Heart, Lung, Abdomen, Back, Extremities, Neuro
* Abdominal pain in women of childbearing age should be treated as an ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise.
* The diagnosis of abdominal aneurysm should be considered with abdominal pain in patients over 50.
* Appendicitis may present with vague, peri-umbilical pain, which migrates to the RLQ over time.
* It is important to remember that abdominal pain can be caused by many different disease processes. The organ systems that may be involved in abdominal pain include esophagus, stomach, intestinal tract, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, male and female genital organs, bladder, as well as referred pain from the chest that can involve the heart, lungs, or pleura. Abdominal pain may also be caused by muscular and skeletal problems.
* Abdominal pain emergencies are likely to lead to death due to hypovolemia. There may also be severe electrolyte abnormalities that can cause arrhythmias.
* Myocardial infarction may present as abdominal pain especially in the diabetic and elderly.
* In some patients, cardiac chest pain may manifest as abdominal pain. Consider this in all patients with abdominal pain, especially patients with diabetes and in women.
* Because the abdominal pain may be of cardiac origin, perform cardiac monitoring and a diagnostic EKG.
* DKA may present with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Check blood glucose level.
* Ketamine use in pregnancy is a risk/benefit assessment per case. Consult Medical Control if there are questions.
