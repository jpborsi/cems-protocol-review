# Pediatric Burns Protocol

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Consider Spinal Motion Restriction Procedure
3. Capnography Procedure
4. If Chest, Neck, Face, Airway Involvement – Prepare for Invasive Airway Procedures
    1. Perform Early Intubation
5. If burn <10% body surface area (using rule of nines):
    1. Cool down wound with NORMAL SALINE and dressings
    2. Remove clothing and/or expose area
    3. Remove rings, bracelets, and other constricting items
    4. Cover burn with dry sterile sheet or dressings
    5. Transport to appropriate facility
    6. Contact receiving facility
    7. Consult Medical Control where indicated
    8. Appropriate transfer of care
6. If burn >20% body surface area:
    1. IV/IO Procedure:
        - AGE 0–5: 20 drops/min (Macrodrip set), not more than 125 ml/hr
        - AGE 6–13: 40 drops/min (Macrodrip set), not more than 250 ml/hr
        - AGE 13+: 80 drops/min (Macrodrip set), not more than 500 ml/hr
7. Initiate Trauma Alert
8. Pediatric Pain Management Protocol
9. See Rule of 9’s chart at the end of this section

### Thermal Burns
1. Stop burning process, i.e. remove patient from heat source, cool skin, remove clothing.
2. If patient starts to shiver or skin is cool, stop cooling process.
3. Estimate extent (%) and depth of burn (see chart).
4. Determine seriousness (see chart), contact Medical Control and transport accordingly.
5. Cover burn areas with sterile dressing.

### Radiation Burns
1. Treat as thermal burns except when burn is contaminated with radioactive source, then treat as chemical burn.
2. Wear appropriate protective clothing when dealing with contamination.
3. Contact HAZ MAT TEAM for assistance in contamination cases.

### Chemical Burns
Criteria: Use if exposure to chemicals or contaminated with chemicals.
1. Wear appropriate protective clothing and respirators.
2. Remove patient from contaminated area to decontamination site (NOT SQUAD).
3. Determine chemicals involved; contact appropriate agency for chemical information.
4. Remove patient's clothing and flush skin.
5. Leave contaminated clothes at scene.
6. Cover patient over and under before loading into squad.
7. Patient should be transported by personnel not involved in decontamination process.
8. Determine severity (see chart), contact Medical Control and transport accordingly.
9. Relay type of substance involved to Medical Control.

### Electrical Burns
1. Shut down electrical source; do not attempt to remove patient until electricity is CONFIRMED to be shut off.
2. Assess for visible entrance and exit wounds and treat as thermal burns.
3. Assess for internal injury, i.e., vascular damage, tissue damage, fractures, and treat accordingly.
4. Determine severity of burn, contact Online Medical Control and transport accordingly.

### Inhalation Burns
Criteria: Suspect if patient found in closed smoky environment, or exhibits burns to face/neck, singed nasal hairs, cough/stridor, soot in sputum.
1. Provide oxygen therapy.
2. Contact Online Medical Control and transport.
3. Initiate early intubation for symptomatic patients with inhalation burns.

#### Eye Injury
- Continuous flushing with Normal Saline
- Flush area with Normal Saline for 10–15 minutes

## Indications
* Burn injury: Thermal, Chemical, Electrical, Radiation
* Eye injury due to burn
* Chest, neck, face, or airway involvement
* Inhalation injury
* Burns with other trauma

## Signs and Symptoms
* Burns, pain, swelling
* Dizziness
* Loss of consciousness
* Hypotension/shock
* Airway compromise/distress
* Singed facial or nasal hair
* Hoarseness/wheezing

## Differential Diagnosis
* Superficial (1°) red and painful
* Partial thickness (2°): superficial partial thickness, deep partial thickness, blistering
* Full thickness (3°): painless and charred or leathery skin
* Chemical burns
* Thermal burns
* Electrical burns
* Radiation burns

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, HEENT, Neck, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremities, Back, Neuro
* Early intubation is required in significant inhalation injuries with airway compromise.
* Critical Burns: >25% body surface area (BSA); full thickness burns >10% BSA; partial thickness superficial partial thickness, deep partial thickness, and full thickness burns to face, eyes, hand or feet; electrical burns; respiratory burns; deep chemical burns; burns with extremes of age or chronic disease; and burns with associated major traumatic injury. These burns may require hospital admission or transfer to a burn center.
* Potential CO exposure should be treated with 100% oxygen.
* Circumferential burns to extremities are dangerous due to potential vascular compromise (partial thickness to soft tissue swelling).
* Burn patients are prone to hypothermia – Never apply ice or cool burns that involve >10% body surface area.
* Do not overlook the possibility of multiple system trauma.
* Do not overlook the possibility of child abuse with children and burn injuries.
* See appendix for rule of nines.
* Handle patients gently to avoid further damage of the patient’s skin.
* If the patient is exposed to a chemical, whenever possible, get the name of the chemical, and document it on the patient run report. DO NOT transport any hazardous materials with the patient.
* Look for signs of dehydration and shock.
* Patients with major burns should be transported to a Regional Burn Center.
* Patients with unstable airway or who are rapidly deteriorating should be transported to the closest appropriate facility.
* Patients with large surface burns lose the ability to regulate their body temperature. Avoid heat loss by covering the patient.

## Other Information
* Body surface area estimation by Rule of Nines (see chart in appendix).
