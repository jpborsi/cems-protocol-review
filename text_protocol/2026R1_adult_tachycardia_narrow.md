# NARROW – COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Apply Cardiac Monitor
3. Oxygen
4. Capnography Procedure
5. IV / IO Procedure
6. Assess if the patient is unstable (SBP < 90, no radial pulses, AMS, chest pain, shock) or symptomatic (stable).
7. Identify rhythm type: Regular or Irregular.
8. Transport to appropriate facility, contact receiving facility, consult Medical Control where indicated, and ensure appropriate transfer of care.

### Unstable / Regular or Irregular Tachycardia
Criteria: SBP < 90, no radial pulses, AMS, chest pain, shock.

1. Consider sedation:
    - Midazolam 2.5 mg IV/IO or 5 mg IM/IN q 5 min prn. Max 10 mg.
    - OR Lorazepam 1–2 mg IV/IO/IM/IN q 10 min prn. Max 4 mg.
    - If Midazolam or Lorazepam unavailable, see medication section for Diazepam.
    - Capnography required.
2. Synchronized Cardioversion 200 J or device recommendation (if regular rhythm).
    - Repeat synchronized cardioversion 300, 360 J or device recommendation.
    - For irregular rhythms (Atrial fibrillation), use extreme caution when cardioverting. Significant potential to cause CVA, especially if duration >48 hrs.
3. If no response in 1–2 minutes, repeat synchronized cardioversion as per recommendations.
4. Diagnostic EKG procedure before and after interventions.

### Stable / Irregular Tachycardia (A-Fib)
Criteria: Patient is symptomatic and rhythm is irregular.

1. Supportive care, treatment of symptoms, and close observation are generally required.
2. Diagnostic EKG procedure.
3. Consider Metoprolol 5 mg IV/IO. Do not confuse with Labetalol. Ask about additional dosing while on call with OLMC.
4. No Adenosine in Atrial Fibrillation, Wolf Parkinson White (WPW), or RVR.
5. Plan for changes; consider if the tachycardia is compensatory or caused by underlying issues such as fever or dehydration.

### Stable / Regular Tachycardia (SVT)
Criteria: Patient is symptomatic and rhythm is regular (does not have P waves or aberrant wide complex regular SVT).

1. Attempt vagal maneuvers (bearing down, coughing, blowing into a syringe). No carotid massage.
2. Adenosine 6 mg IV push, followed by 20 ml normal saline push. Not for rapid Atrial Fibrillation or WPW.
3. If no response in 1–2 minutes, Adenosine 12 mg IV push, followed by 20 ml normal saline (no repeat).
4. Diagnostic EKG procedure, repeat after conversion.
5. Consider normal saline fluid bolus to rule out hypovolemia/dehydration as cause of tachycardia.
    - If signs/symptoms of heart failure, consider Metoprolol 5 mg IV/IO.
6. Diagnostic EKG procedure before and after interventions.
7. If unsure, consult OLMC.

### Wolf Parkinson White (WPW) and Known Atrial Fibrillation
Criteria: Presence of WPW or known atrial fibrillation.

1. **NO ADENOSINE** should be administered.

## Indications
* Narrow-complex tachycardia
* Heart rate > 150 bpm
* Symptomatic unstable or stable tachycardia

## Signs and Symptoms
* Dizziness
* Chest Pain (CP)
* Shortness of Breath (SOB)
* Altered Mental Status (AMS)
* Syncope/near syncope
* HR > 150 bpm
* QRS < .12 sec
* No radial pulses
* Shock

## Differential Diagnosis
* Sinus tachycardia
* Atrial fibrillation/flutter
* Multifocal atrial tachycardia
* Heart disease (WPW, valvular)
* Sick sinus syndrome
* Myocardial infarction
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Exertion, pain, emotional stress
* Fever
* Hypoxia
* Hypovolemia or anemia
* Drug effect/overdose (see history)
* Hyperthyroidism
* Pulmonary embolus

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Skin, Neck, Lung, Heart, Abdomen, Back, Extremities, Neuro
* Monitor for respiratory depression and hypotension associated with Lorazepam.
* Continuous pulse oximetry is required for all tachycardic patients.
* Document all rhythm changes with monitor strips and obtain monitor strips with each intervention.
* If the patient converts to another rhythm, refer to the appropriate protocol and treat accordingly.
* Examples of vagal maneuvers include bearing down, coughing, or blowing into a syringe. DO NOT perform a carotid massage.
* If possible, the IV should be initiated in either AC.
* Consider applying the cardioversion/pacing pads prior to Adenosine administration.
* When administering Adenosine, raise the patient’s arm and immediately follow the bolus with 20 ml rapid bolus of normal saline.
* Record 3-Lead EKG strips during Adenosine administration.
* Perform a diagnostic EKG prior to and after Adenosine conversion or after cardioversion.
* If the patient converts into ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, immediately DEFIBRILLATE the patient and refer to the appropriate protocol and treat accordingly. Be sure to switch the defibrillator out of “Sync” before defibrillating.
* Give a copy of the EKGs and/or code summaries with the receiving facility upon arrival.
* Transient periods of sinus bradycardia and ventricular ectopy are common after termination of SVT.
* It is unlikely that symptoms of instability are caused primarily by the tachycardia when the HR is <150 unless there is impaired ventricular function.
* Pay attention for P waves. Sinus tach from underlying problems requires treatment of the underlying problem. Ex. PE, hypovolemia.

## Other Information
### History Considerations
* Medications (Aminophylline, diet pills, thyroid supplements, decongestants, digoxin)
* Diet (caffeine, chocolate)
* Drugs (nicotine, cocaine)
* Past medical history
* History of palpitations/heart racing
* Syncope/near syncope
