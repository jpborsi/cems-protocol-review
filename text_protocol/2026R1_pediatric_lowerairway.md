# Pediatric Protocol: Respiratory Distress Lower Airway

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. Position to Patient Comfort
3. Determine Severity:
    1. Mild
        - TRANSPORT to appropriate facility.
        - CONTACT receiving facility.
        - CONSULT Medical Control where indicated.
        - APPROPRIATE transfer of care.
    2. Moderate / Severe
        - IV PROCEDURE (Attempt only if severe respiratory distress.)
4. Assess for Respiratory Failure:
    1. PULSE OXIMETERY PROCEDURE – Administer O2
    2. Pediatric Airway Protocol
    3. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
    4. CARDIAC MONITOR
5. If patient presents with stridor, or a “seal bark cough”, it is an upper airway etiology and should be treated by the Respiratory Distress Upper Airway – Croup Protocol.
6. If repeat treatment required, proceed to next applicable treatment.

### Mild Respiratory Distress
1. ALBUTEROL Nebulized Unit Dose 2.5 mg
    - EMT may administer only with proper training or ONLINE Medical Control
2. If Repeat Treatment Required
    - ALBUTEROL/IPRATROPIUM Nebulized Unit Dose, May Repeat x1 if required.
    - EMT may administer only with proper training or ONLINE Medical Control

### Moderate / Severe Respiratory Distress
1. ALBUTEROL/IPRATROPIUM Nebulized Unit Dose
    - q 10 min up to 3 doses
    - EMT may administer only with proper training or ONLINE Medical Control
2. If evidence of poor air exchange:
    - EPINEPHrine 0.01 mg/kg IM of 1 mg/ml Concentration, q 5 min prn - Max dose 0.5 mg
    - methylPREDNISolone 2 mg/kg IV/IO/IM/PO, No Repeat - Max Dose 125 mg
3. Consider MAGNESIUM SULFATE 50 mg/kg IV/IO - 2 grams Max IV over 20 mins

### Special Considerations
- Patients under 2 years with no history of asthma: CONSIDER BRONCHIOLITIS. Treat with OXYGEN. Bronchodilators ineffective.

## Indications
* Pediatric patient with respiratory distress characterized by signs and symptoms below.

## Signs and Symptoms
* Wheezing or stridor
* Respiratory retractions
* Increased heart rate
* Altered level of consciousness
* Anxious appearance

## Differential Diagnosis
* Asthma
* Aspiration
* Foreign body
* Infection
* Pneumonia
* Croup
* Epiglottitis
* Congenital heart disease
* Medication or toxin
* Trauma

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, HEENT, Skin, Neck, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremities, Neuro
* Do not force a child into a position. They will protect their airway by their body position.
* The most important component of respiratory distress is airway control.
* DO NOT attempt an invasive airway procedure unless the patient is in respiratory arrest.
* For some patients in severe respiratory distress, wheezing may not be heard.
* Use Albuterol and Ipratropium for the known asthmatic in severe respiratory distress.
* Stridor, gagging or choking in the breathing patient with respiratory distress may indicate upper airway obstruction.
* Wheezing in the breathing patient with respiratory distress indicates lower airway disease, which may come from a variety of causes. The patient with severe lower airway disease may have altered LOC, be unable to talk, may have absent or markedly decreased breath sounds and severe retractions with accessory muscle use.
* If the patient has signs of respiratory failure, begin to assist ventilations with BVM, even when they are breathing.

## Other Information
* HISTORY:
    - Time of onset
    - Possibility of foreign body
    - Medical history
    - Medications
    - Fever or respiratory infection
    - Other sick siblings
    - History of trauma

* If the patient presents with stridor, or a “seal bark cough”, it is an upper airway etiology and should be treated by the Respiratory Distress Upper Airway – Croup Protocol.
