# Pediatric Protocol: Airway

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Assess ABC’s
    1. Assess respiratory rate, effort, and adequacy
    2. Provide supplemental oxygen as needed
3. Continue with further steps as necessary based on respiratory status:
    1. If respirations are adequate: Continue to oxygenate, ventilate, position, and reassess as needed
    2. If respirations are inadequate (obstruction, apnea, or no gag reflex): Proceed to further management steps, as detailed below

### Airway Management Decision Path

If respirations are INADEQUATE:

1. If positive respirations/gag reflex but evidence of airway obstruction:
    1. Proceed to Pediatric Foreign Body Airway Obstruction Protocol
    2. Consider direct laryngoscopy
    3. Oxygenate, ventilate, position, and reassess
    4. Continue with bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilations if necessary
2. If apneic/no gag reflex:
    1. Attempt removal of obstruction with Magill forceps
    2. If unable to manage airway, consider needle cricothyrotomy procedure if trained and equipment available
    3. Transport to appropriate facility
    4. Contact receiving facility and consult Medical Control where indicated
    5. Ensure appropriate transfer of care
    6. Capnography procedure required for all intubations

### Extraglottic Airway Device / Blind Insertion Airway Device (BIAD)

1. Basic airway maneuvers FIRST: open airway, nasal/oral airway, bag-valve-mask
2. Consider intubation procedure if unable to manage airway with BVM/extraglottic airway (BIAD)
3. Continue BVM ventilations and rapid transport if intubation is unsuccessful
4. ETCO2 measurement is mandatory for all methods of intubation

### Management of Tracheostomy Patients

1. Have suction equipment on hand throughout all phases of treatment and transport; suction to maintain patency as required
2. If a tracheostomy becomes dislodged and cannot be reinserted, use an ET tube sized to the stoma size
3. If a tracheostomy comes out and can be reinserted or needs changed, utilize a bougie (tube changer) if available to insert into stoma and “railroad” the tracheostomy over the bougie into place
4. Check all cuffed tracheostomy cuffs for patency; add additional air if an air leak is appreciated around the stoma
5. If a tracheostomy patient cannot be bagged effectively, suspect mucous plug. Alternate trachea lavage with saline, suction, and bagging until resolved
6. If a tracheostomy patient presents with increased work of breathing, remove and inspect inner cannula
7. Take an extra tracheostomy kit or inner cannula with you during transport if available at pickup location
8. Utilize patients and their caregivers as resources
9. See procedures section for stoma and tracheostomy care procedures

### Differentiation of Obstruction Type

- Differentiate airway obstruction from esophageal obstruction.
- If esophageal obstruction, place patient in position of comfort, suction as needed, and treat pain.

## Indications
* Apnea
* Coughing
* Choking
* Inability to speak
* Unresponsive
* Burns
* Trauma
* Witnessed aspiration

## Signs and Symptoms
* Sudden episode of choking
* Gagging
* Audible stridor
* Change in skin color
* Decreased level of consciousness (LOC)
* Increased or decreased respiratory rate
* Labored breathing
* Unproductive cough

## Differential Diagnosis
* Cardiac arrest
* Respiratory arrest
* Anaphylaxis
* Esophageal obstruction

## Key Points
* EtCO2 measurement is mandatory with all methods of intubation. Document results of SpO2.
* Limit intubation attempts to 2 per patient max.
* BVM and oral airway is acceptable means of airway control and ventilation during prehospital care.
* If unable to intubate, continue BVM ventilations, transport rapidly, and notify receiving hospital early.
* Provide Spinal Motion Restriction for patients with suspected spinal injury.
* Do not assume hyperventilation is psychogenic – use oxygen, not a paper bag.
* Continuous pulse oximetry should be utilized in all patients with inadequate respiratory function.
* Consider c-collar to help maintain ETT placement for all intubated patients.

## Other Information

### Tracheostomy Information

Tracheostomies come in 2 types:
- **Cuffed tracheostomy**: Has a distal cuff to create seal in patient trachea. Necessary for patients requiring mechanical ventilation. There is a ET tube-like pilot balloon to verify cuff patency once placed in the tracheal stoma. Select devices may be filled with saline rather than air, this is device specific. Nearly all will be filled with air.
- **Uncuffed tracheostomy**: Does not have distal cuff and does not seal in the trachea. This type is used for spontaneously breathing patients who require an alternate airway due to upper airway defect. These patients may be able to speak with the use of special tracheostomies or valves.

Tracheostomies have 2 essential parts:
- **Outer cannula**: This is the base that secures in the tracheal stoma. If it is cuffed tracheostomy, the cuff is on this section. There are “wings” that allow for attachment of a tie around the patient’s neck. Some recently placed devices may be sutured in place.
- **Inner cannula**: Is removable for cleaning/replacement. Usually clips or is locked in with a quarter turn detent.

> Pediatric tracheostomies may not have inner cannulas due to their size.
