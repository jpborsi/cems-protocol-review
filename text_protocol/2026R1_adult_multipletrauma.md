# Multiple Trauma

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Rapid Trauma Assessment
3. Consider air transport if delay due to extrication
4. Bleeding / Hemorrhage Control Procedure
5. Spinal Motion Restriction Procedure
6. IV / IO Procedure
7. Assess Vital Signs / Perfusion
8. Ongoing Assessment
    1. Reassess Airway
    2. Ventilate appropriately
9. Normal Saline Bolus to maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 (100 systolic if >70 years old) if MAP unavailable or radial pulses
10. Attach Cardiac Monitor
11. Monitor and Reassess
12. Capnography Procedure
13. Transport to appropriate facility
14. Contact receiving facility
15. Consult Medical Control where indicated
16. Appropriate transfer of care
17. Initiate Trauma Alert

### Ongoing/Further Procedures
* If abnormal assessment findings:
    1. Reassess airway
    2. Ventilate appropriately
    3. Normal Saline Bolus (see criteria above)
    4. Monitor and reassess
    5. Attach Cardiac Monitor
    6. Capnography Procedure
    7. Transport to appropriate facility
    8. Contact receiving facility
    9. Consult Medical Control where indicated
    10. Appropriate transfer of care
    11. Initiate Trauma Alert
    12. Pain Management Protocol
    13. If continued hypotension: 
        - Consider traumatic needle chest decompression procedure
        - Pain Management Protocol
    14. If evidence of current/previous uncontrolled hemorrhage, HR > 120 and/or SBP < 90, within 60 mins of injury:
        - Consider Tranexamic Acid (TXA), 2 Grams (2000 mg) IV/IO slow push over 10 min or 2 Grams IV/IO (2000 mg) mixed in 100 ml D5W over 10 mins

### Pain Management Protocol
* Refer to Pain Management Protocol for pain management intervention as indicated by assessment and ongoing evaluation.

## Indications
* Multiple trauma
* Mechanism of serious injury
* Prolonged extrication or serious trauma
* Suspected need for air transportation due to transport times and ability to give blood

## Signs and Symptoms
* Pain, swelling
* Deformity, lesions, bleeding
* Altered mental status or unconscious
* Hypotension or shock
* Arrest

## Differential Diagnosis
* Flail chest
* Tension pneumothorax
* Pericardial tamponade
* Open chest wound
* Hemothorax
* Intra-abdominal bleeding
* Pelvis/femur fracture
* Spine fracture / spinal cord injury
* Head injury
* Extremity fracture/dislocation
* HEENT (airway obstruction)
* Hypothermia

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Skin, HEENT, Heart, Lung, Abdomen, Extremities, Back, Neuro
* Mechanism is the most reliable indicator of serious injury.
* In prolonged extrications or serious trauma, consider air transportation for transport times and the ability to give blood.
* Do not overlook the possibility of associated domestic violence or abuse.
* Pelvic pain with hypotension or tachycardia should have a pelvic binder placed.
