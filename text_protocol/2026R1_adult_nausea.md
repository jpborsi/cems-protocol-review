## Indications

## Differential Diagnosis
* Consider AMI / Diagnostic EKG
* Gastroenteritis
* Toxic ingestion / food poisoning
* Bowel obstruction
* Appendicitis
* Gastritis
* Cholecystitis (gallbladder)
* Hepatitis / cirrhosis
* Headaches / migraine
* Pregnancy
* Hypertensive crisis
* Electrolyte imbalances
* DKA
* Intracranial pressure
* Sepsis / infections

## Key Points
* Position patient to protect airway as appropriate. (Recovery position, sitting up, etc.)
* Immediately position entire patient or their head to side if patient begins vomiting then retrieve suction.
* Patients with altered LOC and nausea / vomiting need to have airway maintenance prioritized before medication.
* Prepare and test suction prior to its need.
* Give Ondansetron or Metoclopramide over at least 2 minutes, slow IV. Follow up with second dose if symptoms unresolved.
* Treat patients early, no need to wait for patient to begin vomiting to administer Ondansetron or Metoclopramide.
* Patients receiving medications such as narcotic analgesics may require concurrent administration of Ondansetron or Metoclopramide to reduce nausea associated with such medications.
