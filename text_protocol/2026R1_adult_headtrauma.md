# Head Trauma

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
    1. Oxygen for all head trauma
2. Spinal Motion Restriction Procedure
3. Bleeding/Hemorrhage Control Procedure
4. IV / IO Procedure
    1. Limit IV fluids due to cerebral edema
    2. To maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 (100 systolic if >70 years old) if MAP unavailable or radial pulses
    3. Do NOT allow patient to become hypotensive
5. Patient Assessment
    1. Determine and Trend Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)
6. Continue according to the following branches:

### Isolated Uncomplicated Head Trauma (GCS 15)
1. Airway Protocol
2. Do NOT hyperventilate
3. Transport to appropriate facility
4. Contact receiving facility
5. Consult Medical Control where indicated
6. Appropriate transfer of care

### Evidence of, or Suspect Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) (GCS < 15)
Criteria: Any head-injured patient with GCS < 15

1. Initiate Trauma Alert
2. Airway Protocol
    1. Do NOT allow patient to become hypoxic during any airway management – 100% oxygen
    2. Maintain SpO2 > 94% at all times!
    3. Do NOT hyperventilate
    4. Ventilate to maintain CO2 35 or 12 breaths/min
    5. Apply capnography if advanced airway used
3. IV / IO Procedure 
    1. Normal saline bolus to maintain MAP > 80 or SBP 120 if MAP unavailable or radial pulses
    2. Do NOT allow patient to become hypotensive
4. Monitor and reassess

### Additional Pathways (as indicated by assessment)
- Multiple Trauma Protocol (if not isolated head trauma)
- Altered Level of Consciousness Protocol
- Seizure Protocol (if seizure activity)

## Indications
* Head trauma including suspected or confirmed traumatic brain injury
* Isolated or complicated head injury
* Significant mechanism of injury

## Signs and Symptoms
* Pain, swelling, bleeding
* Altered mental status
* Unconscious
* Respiratory distress/failure
* Vomiting
* Significant mechanism of injury

## Differential Diagnosis
* Skull fracture
* Brain injury (concussion, contusion, hemorrhage, or laceration)
* Epidural hematoma
* Subdural hematoma
* Subarachnoid hemorrhage
* Spinal injury
* Abuse

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremities, Back, Neuro
* If GCS < 12 consider air/rapid transport and if GCS < 9 intubation should be anticipated.
* GCS < 8? Intubate!
* DO NOT allow patients to become hypoxic, maintain SpO2 > 94%, abandon intubation attempts if this cannot be maintained. Secure airway by other means.
* Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) may cause hypertension and bradycardia (Cushing's Reflex).
* Hypotension usually indicates injury or shock unrelated to the head injury and should be aggressively treated.
* Limit IV fluids unless patient is hypotensive (systolic BP < 90) fluid resuscitate if necessary to maintain BP, Do NOT allow patients to become hypotensive.
* DO NOT attempt to lower the blood pressure in hypertensive head injured patients with medications such as Nitroglycerine (Nitro-Stat).
* Be alert for c-spine injuries with head trauma.
* Continually reassess the patient, including pupils, LOC, and neurological status.
* Any decrease in GCS suggests a TBI surgical emergency, transport to trauma center.
* Capnography is critical! Maintain the CO2 ranges indicated in protocol, 1 point of CO2 change = 3% decrease in cerebral perfusion.
* The most important item to monitor, trend, and document is a change in the level of consciousness / GCS.
* Herniation may occur. Signs are:
    * Cushing’s reflex; Bradycardia, hypertension, widening pulse pressure
    * Decreasing level of consciousness progressing towards coma
    * Dilation of pupils – may be unilateral or bilateral
    * Decerebrate posturing (extension of arms and legs)
    * Decorticate posturing (flexion arms and legs)
* Concussions are periods of confusion or LOC associated with trauma, which may have resolved by the time EMS arrives. A physician ASAP should evaluate any prolonged confusion or mental status abnormality, which does not return to normal within 15 minutes or any documented loss of consciousness.
* Consider Restraints if necessary for patient's and/or personnel's protection per the RESTRAINT PROCEDURE.

## Other Information

### History
