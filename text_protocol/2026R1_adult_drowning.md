# DROWNING

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. Patient Assessment
3. Airway Management  
    1. Initiate ventilation while patient is still in water if not breathing.
    2. Consider SPINAL MOTION RESTRICTION PROCEDURE.
    3. Place backboard while still in water if able.
4. IV / IO PROCEDURE  
    1. Normal Saline TKO
5. Apply Cardiac Monitor
6. If Hypothermic, treat per HYPOTHERMIA PROTOCOL.
7. If Decompression Sickness, give oxygen – no positive pressure ventilation unless NOT breathing.
8. Oxygen ASAP
9. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
10. Monitor and Reassess
11. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
12. CONTACT receiving facility
13. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
14. APPROPRIATE transfer of care

### Spinal Motion Restriction/Boarding
Criteria: Consider for all drowning patients, especially if trauma suspected or unknown mechanism.
1. Place backboard while still in water if able.

### Decompression Sickness Treatment
Criteria: Suspected decompression illness (barotrauma, diving).
1. Give oxygen.
2. Do not provide positive pressure ventilation unless patient is NOT breathing.

### Hypothermia Management
Criteria: If the patient is hypothermic.
1. Treat per HYPOTHERMIA PROTOCOL.

## Indications
* Submersion in water regardless of depth
* Possible trauma (i.e.; fall, diving board)
* Duration of immersion
* Temperature of water
* Salt vs. fresh water
* Period of unconsciousness

## Signs and Symptoms
* Unresponsive
* Mental status changes
* Decreased or absent vital signs
* Vomiting
* Coughing
* Trauma

## Differential Diagnosis
* Pre-existing medical problem
* Barotrauma (diving)
* Decompression sickness

## Key Points
* Exam: Trauma Survey, Head, Neck, Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis, Back, Extremities, Skin, Neuro
* Drowning due to suffocation from submersion in water.
* Two causes – breath holding which leads to aspiration of water; & laryngospasm which closes the glottis.
* Both causes lead to profound hypoxia and death.
* Fresh water drowning – ventricular fibrillation may be likely.
* Salt water drowning may cause pulmonary edema in time.
* Pulmonary edema can develop within 24-48 hours after submersion.
* EMS should be aware that there may be delayed symptoms in some cases.
* Patients WITHOUT vital sign abnormalities may follow standard refusal of care protocols.
* Drowning is a leading cause of death among would-be rescuers.
* Allow appropriately trained and certified rescuers to remove victims from areas of danger.
* With pressure injuries (decompression / barotrauma), consider transport for availability of a hyperbaric chamber.
* All hypothermic / drowning patients should have resuscitation performed until care is transferred, or if there are other signs of obvious death (putrification, traumatic injury unsustainable to life).
* Consider a c-spine injury in all drowning cases.
* Patients with low core temperatures will not respond to ALS drug interventions. Maintain warming procedures and supportive care. Treat per hypothermic arrest protocol.
* DO NOT perform the Heimlich maneuver to remove water from the lungs prior to resuscitation.
