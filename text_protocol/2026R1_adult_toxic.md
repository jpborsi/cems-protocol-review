# TOXIC INGESTION / EXPOSURE / OVERDOSE

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. Patient Assessment (HISTORY, SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS)
3. Continue with further steps as necessary per specific findings:
    1. If suspected Carbon Monoxide (CO) or Cyanide Poisoning, see Specific Protocol.
    2. TAKE PPE PRECAUTIONS – GLOVES / MASK minimum. Contact / aerosol risk with fentanyl-based substances.
    3. Decontaminate and remove clothes if patient is exposed to any dangerous or noxious substances.
    4. If it can be done safely, take whatever container the substance came from to the hospital along with readily obtainable samples of medication unless this results in an unreasonable delay of transport.
    5. IF APPLICABLE, DO NOT transport a patient to the hospital until properly decontaminated.
    6. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility. CONTACT receiving facility. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated. APPROPRAITE transfer of care.

### Narcotic Overdose (AMS / Respiratory Depression)
Criteria: Obvious or suspected opiate overdose with altered mental status and respiratory depression.

1. ASSURE BLS VENTILATION WITH BVM
2. NALOXONE 2–8 mg IN Atomized. May repeat every 2 min as necessary if obvious or suspected opiate OD until respiratory improvement or 12 mg Max.
    - If no response to IN dose, SUMMON ALS.
3. NALOXONE 1–2 mg IV/IM/IO
4. If patient is unresponsive to Naloxone, supply is exhausted, or medication unavailable, consider Advanced Airway and Support Hemodynamically.
5. Support Hemodynamically. Utilize Shock Protocol.
6. MONITOR for combative behavior after Naloxone administration.
7. All A&O 4 patients having received Naloxone should be transported. If patient refuses transport, contact Online Medical Control before release.

### Organophosphates / Carbamates Exposure
Criteria: Exposure to insecticides (organophosphates / carbamates), with or without increased secretions.

1. Decontaminate and remove clothes if exposed.
2. ATROPINE 1 mg IV/IO q 3–5 min as needed to control secretions. No max dose.
3. May use DuoDote kit if available – see Nerve Agent Antidote Kit Protocol.

### Salicylate (ASA) Overdose (Not Acetaminophen)
Criteria: Suspected salicylate ingestion; not for Tylenol (Acetaminophen).

1. If candidate for advanced airway, SODIUM BICARBONATE 1 mEq/kg SLOW IV/IO prior to attempt.
2. IV NORMAL SALINE BOLUS 20 ml/kg.
3. COOLING MEASURES IF FEBRILE.

### Sympathomimetic Overdose (Stimulants)
Criteria: Suspected stimulant overdose.

1. If DIAGNOSTIC EKG suggestive of STEMI, treat per ACS protocol.
2. If patient is AGITATED or has CHEST PAIN:
    - MIDAZOLAM 2.5 mg IV/IO or 5 mg IM/IN q 5 min prn (Max 10 mg)
    - OR LORazepam 1–2 mg IV/IO/IM/IN q 5 min prn (Max 4 mg)
    - If Midazolam or LORazepam unavailable, see medication section for diazePAM.
3. If tachypneic, SODIUM BICARBONATE 1 mEq/kg SLOW IV/IO.

### Airway / Breathing Support
1. IF AMS and NORMAL (bad) or LOW respiratory rate: BVM and ventilatory rate to make CO2 of 30.
2. OXYGEN
3. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
4. AIRWAY PROTOCOL
5. If wheezing: Treat with aerosol ALBUTEROL / IPRATROPIUM (AEMT may administer only with proper training or ONLINE Medical Control).
6. Consider Advanced Airway / RSI Protocol Where Indicated.
7. IF SEIZURES:
    - MIDAZOLAM 2.5 mg IV/IO or 5 mg IM/IN q 5 min prn (Max 10 mg)
    - OR LORazepam 1–2 mg IV/IO/IM/IN q 5 min prn (Max 4 mg)
    - If Midazolam or LORazepam unavailable, see medication section for diazePAM.

### Metabolic Intervention
1. IV/IO PROCEDURE
2. BLOOD GLUCOSE PROCEDURE
3. IF AMS REGARDLESS OF BGL READING: DEXTROSE 10% 12.5 grams IV/IO. May repeat prn.
    - If Dextrose 10% unavailable, see medication section for DEXTROSE 50%.

### Diagnostic
1. DIAGNOSTIC EKG PROCEDURE and Assess Vitals

## Indications
* Ingestion or suspected ingestion of a potentially toxic substance.
* Substance ingested, route, quantity.
* Time of ingestion.
* Reason (suicidal, accidental, criminal).
* Available medications in home.
* Past medical history, medications.

## Signs and Symptoms
* Mental status changes
* Hypo / hypertension
* Decreased respiratory rate
* Tachycardia, dysrhythmias
* Seizures

## Differential Diagnosis
* Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)
* Acetaminophen (Tylenol)
* Depressants
* Stimulants
* Anticholinergic
* Cardiac medications
* Solvents, alcohols, cleaning agents
* Insecticides (organophosphates)
* Respiratory depression
* Other organophosphates
* Carbamates

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Skin, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremities, Neuro.
* Do not rely on patient history of ingestion, especially in suicide attempts.
* Bring bottles, contents, and emesis to ED.
* Tricyclic: 4 major areas of toxicity: seizures, dysrhythmias, hypotension, decreased mental status or coma; rapid progression from alert mental status to death.
* Acetaminophen: initially normal or nausea/vomiting. If not detected and treated, causes irreversible liver failure.
* Depressants: decreased HR, decreased BP, decreased temperature, decreased respirations, non-specific pupils.
* Stimulants: increased HR, increased BP, increased temperature, dilated pupils, and seizures.
* Anticholinergics: increased HR, increased temperature, dilated pupils, and mental status changes.
* Cardiac Medications: dysrhythmias and mental status changes.
* Solvents: nausea, vomiting, and mental status changes.
* Insecticides: increased or decreased HR, increased secretions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pinpoint pupils.
* Consider restraints if necessary for patient's and/or personnel's protection per the Restraint Procedure.
* If it can be done safely, take whatever container the substance came from to the hospital along with readily obtainable samples of medication unless this results in an unreasonable delay of transport.
* If applicable, DO NOT transport a patient to the hospital until properly decontaminated.
* Naloxone (Narcan) administration may cause the patient to go into acute opiate withdrawal, which includes vomiting, agitation, and/or combative behavior. Always be prepared for combative behavior.
* Naloxone (Narcan) goal is to reverse life-threatening respiratory depression.
* Naloxone (Narcan) may wear off in as little as 20 minutes causing the patient to become more sedate and possibly hypoventilate. All A&O 4 patients having received Naloxone (Narcan) should be transported. If patient refuses transport, contact Online Medical Control before release.
