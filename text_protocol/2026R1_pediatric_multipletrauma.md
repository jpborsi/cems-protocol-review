# Pediatric Protocol: Multiple Trauma

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Rapid Trauma Assessment
    1. Consider air transport if delay due to extrication.
    2. Consider Spinal Motion Restriction Procedure.
3. Pediatric Airway Protocol
4. IV / IO Procedure
5. Assess Vital Signs / Perfusion
6. Reassess Airway / Ongoing Assessment
7. Decision Point: Abnormal vs. Normal Assessment
    1. If abnormal:
        - Ventilate appropriately.
        - Treat per appropriate protocol.
        - NORMAL SALINE BOLUS 20 ml/kg – repeat as needed.
        - Monitor and Reassess.
    2. If normal:
        - Ongoing assessment.
        - Treat per appropriate protocol.
        - Pediatric Pain Protocol.
8. Attach Cardiac Monitor
9. Capnography Procedure
10. Transport to appropriate facility
11. Contact receiving facility
12. Consult Medical Control where indicated.
13. Appropriate transfer of care
14. Initiate Trauma Alert

### Ongoing Assessment and Advanced Steps
If continued hypotension:
1. Consider Traumatic Needle Chest Decompression Procedure.
2. If evidence of current/previous uncontrolled hemorrhage, sustained HR > 120 and/or SBP < 90 (for age), within 60 mins of injury:
    - Consider Tranexamic Acid (TXA) 15 mg/kg mixed in 100 ml D5W over 10 mins – Max 1 gram.

## Indications
* Pediatric Trauma Victim: Person < 16 years of age exhibiting one or more of the following physiological or anatomical conditions.

### Physiological Conditions
* Glasgow Coma Scale < 13
* Loss of consciousness > 5 minutes
* Deterioration in level of consciousness at the scene or during transport
* Failure to localize to pain
* Evidence of poor perfusion or evidence of respiratory distress or failure

### Anatomical Conditions
* Penetrating trauma to head, neck, or torso
* Significant, penetrating trauma to extremities proximal to the knee or elbow with evidence of neurovascular compromise
* Injuries to the head, neck, or torso where the following physical findings are present: visible crush injury; abdominal tenderness, distention, or seatbelt sign; pelvic fracture; flail chest
* Injuries to the extremities where the following physical findings are present: amputations proximal to the wrist or ankle; visible crush injury; fractures of two or more proximal long bones; evidence of neurovascular compromise
* Signs or symptoms of spinal cord injury
* 2nd or 3rd degree burns > 10% total BSA, or other significant burns involving the face, feet, hands, genitalia, or airway

## Signs and Symptoms
* Pain, swelling
* Deformity, lesions, bleeding
* Altered mental status
* Unconscious
* Hypotension or shock
* Arrest

## Differential Diagnosis
Life Threatening:
* Chest tension pneumothorax
* Flail chest
* Pericardial tamponade
* Open chest wound
* Hemothorax
* Intra-abdominal bleeding
* Pelvis/femur fracture
* Spine fracture/cord injury
* Head injury (see Head trauma)
* Extremity fracture/dislocation
* HEENT (airway obstruction)
* Hypothermia

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Skin, HEENT, Heart, Lung, Abdomen, Extremities, Back, Neuro
* Mechanism is the most reliable indicator of serious injury. Examine all restraints/protective equipment for damage.
* In prolonged extrications or serious trauma consider air transportation for transport times and the ability to give blood.
* Do not overlook the possibility for child abuse.
* A trauma victim is a pediatric patient if they are < 16 years old.
* Major trauma patients are to be transported to the closest pediatric trauma center.
* Contact the receiving hospital for all major trauma or critical patients.
* The proper size equipment is very important to resuscitation care. Refer to length-based drug treatment guide (e.g., Broselow Pediatric Emergency Tape or similar guide) when unsure about patient weight, age and/or drug dosage and when choosing equipment size.
* Cover open wounds, burns, eviscerations.
* Except for airway control, initiate ALS enroute when transporting major trauma patients.
* If unable to access patient airway and ventilate, then transport to the closest facility for airway stabilization.
* The on-scene time for major trauma patients should not exceed 10 minutes without documented, acceptable reason for the delay.
* When initiating an IV and drawing blood, collect a red top blood tube to assist the receiving hospital with determining the patient’s blood type.
* All major trauma patients should receive oxygen administration, an IV(s), and cardiac monitoring.
* Provide a documented reason if an intervention could not be performed.
* Transport to a Pediatric Trauma center when able.
* Fluid Resuscitate to systolic of 70 + 2 x age

## Other Information
* Weight, height, and weight-based dosages reference (in kg, lbs, inches) for pediatric dosing.
* Time and mechanism of injury, damage to structure or vehicle, location in structure or vehicle, others injured or dead, speed and details of MVC, restraints/protective equipment, car seat, helmet, pads, ejection, past medical history, medications (to be gathered in history).
