# Pediatric Protocol: Ventricular Fibrillation / Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia

## Overall Procedure

1. Initiate Prompt CPR
2. Apply Cardiac Monitor / AED
3. Confirm V-Fib / Pulseless V-Tach
4. Defibrillate 2 J/kg not to exceed adult dose or AED
5. Follow Pediatric Airway Protocol
6. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
7. Continue as follows:
    1. CPR x 5 cycles / 2 minutes
    2. Defibrillate 4 J/kg not to exceed adult dose or AED
    3. EPINEPHrine 0.01 mg/kg IV/IO (0.1 mg/ml concentration). Repeat every 3 - 5 minutes. Max dose 1 mg per dose. Double-check EPI concentration.
    4. CPR x 5 cycles / 2 minutes
    5. Defibrillate 4 J/kg not to exceed adult dose or AED
    6. AMIODARONE 5 mg/kg IV/IO – May repeat up to 3 total doses. Max dose 300 mg.
        * If Amiodarone unavailable, see Medication Section for Lidocaine.
    7. CPR x 5 cycles / 2 minutes
    8. Defibrillate 4 J/kg not to exceed adult dose or AED (may consider up to 10 J/kg not to exceed adult dose)
    9. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
    10. CONTACT receiving facility
    11. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
    12. APPROPRIATE transfer of care

If Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) occurs at any time, go to Pediatric Post Resuscitation Cardiac Care Protocol.

Identify possible causes:
* Hypoxemia
* Acidosis
* Hypovolemia
* Tension Pneumothorax
* Hypothermia

## Indications

* Unresponsive
* Cardiac arrest

## Signs and Symptoms

* Respiratory failure
* Foreign body
* Secretions
* Infection (croup, epiglottitis)
* Hypovolemia (dehydration)

## Differential Diagnosis

* Congenital heart disease
* Trauma
* Tension pneumothorax
* Hypothermia
* Toxin or medication
* Hypoglycemia
* Acidosis

## Key Points

* Exam: Mental Status
* Monophasic and Biphasic waveform defibrillators should use the same energy levels noted.
* In order to be successful in pediatric arrests, a cause must be identified and corrected.
* Airway is the most important intervention. This should be accomplished immediately. Patient survival is often dependent on airway management success.
* If the patient converts to another rhythm, follow the appropriate protocol and treat accordingly.
* If the patient converts back to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, defibrillate at the previously used setting.
* Defibrillation is the definitive therapy for ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia.
* Defibrillate 30 - 60 seconds after each medication administration.
* The proper administration sequence is CPR (continuous), shock, drug, shock, drug.
