# POST – RESUSCITATION CARDIAC CARE (Pediatric Protocol)

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. Continue Ventilatory Support with 100% OXYGEN
3. IV / IO PROCEDURE
4. DIAGNOSTIC EKG PROCEDURE
5. Monitor Vital Signs
6. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
7. Proceed with further treatment as appropriate:
    1. If bradycardia, treat per BRADYCARDIA PROTOCOL.
    2. If hypotension, administer IV NORMAL SALINE BOLUS (20 ml / kg).
        * Contact Medical Control for the use of vasopressors if failed fluid bolus.
        * EPINEPHrine PUSH DOSE: Make 10 mcg / ml — 1 mcg / kg, Max Dose 10 mcg, 2-5 min slow push, titrate to effect.
    3. If electrical conversion is required (and no anti-arrhythmic was given during resuscitation), proceed with conversion.
    4. If anti-arrhythmic conversion is indicated, proceed with conversion if no anti-arrhythmic has already been administered.
    5. If bradycardia is present, supportive care only, no anti-arrhythmic administered.
    6. If arrest reoccurs, revert to appropriate protocol and/or initial successful treatment.
    7. Treat fever with cooling measures if indicated.

### Sub-Procedure: Bradycardia Management
* If the patient is profoundly bradycardic, refer to the Pediatric BRADYCARDIA PROTOCOL and treat accordingly.

### Sub-Procedure: SVT Management
* Post resuscitation SVT should initially be left alone, but routinely monitor the patient. Follow Pediatric NARROW COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA PROTOCOL or contact Medical Control.

### Sub-Procedure: Hypotension Management
1. Administer IV NORMAL SALINE BOLUS 20 ml / kg.
2. If failed fluid bolus, contact Medical Control for the use of vasopressors.
3. EPINEPHrine PUSH DOSE: Make 10 mcg / ml
    * 1 mcg / kg
    * Max Dose 10 mcg
    * 2 - 5 min - slow push
    * Titrate to effect

## Indications
* Respiratory arrest
* Cardiac arrest
* Return of pulse

## Signs and Symptoms
* Continue to address specific differentials associated with the original dysrhythmia

## Differential Diagnosis
* Continue to address specific differentials associated with the original dysrhythmia

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Neck, Skin, Lungs, Heart, Abdomen, Extremities, Neuro
* Most patients immediately post resuscitation will require ventilatory assistance.
* The condition of post-resuscitation patients fluctuates rapidly and continuously, and they require close monitoring.
* Appropriate post-resuscitation management can best be planned in consultation with Online Medical Control.
* This is the period of time between restoration of spontaneous circulation and the transfer of care at the emergency department. The focus is aimed at optimizing oxygenation and perfusion.
* Only administer oxygen if the patient is hypoxic with a SpO2 of 94 or less. Do not withhold oxygen from patients that are short of breath regardless of SpO2.

## Other Information
* TRANSPORT to appropriate PEDIATRIC facility, CONTACT receiving facility, and CONSULT Medical Control where indicated for APPROPRIATE transfer of care.
