# POST – RESUSCITATION CARDIAC CARE

## Overall Procedure
1. Assure Secured Airway
2. Continue Ventilatory Support with OXYGEN  
   - Target SpO2 92 – 98%
3. Assure IV / IO Access Patency
4. DIAGNOSTIC EKG PROCEDURE
5. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE  
   - Target CO2 35 - 45
6. Monitor Vital Signs
7. Strongly encourage transport of resuscitated patient to facility with hypothermic resuscitation protocol and PCI where available.
8. If arrest reoccurs, revert to appropriate protocol and/or initial successful treatment
9. Transport to appropriate facility; contact receiving facility; consult Medical Control where indicated; appropriate transfer of care

### Bradycardia Management
For post-resuscitation bradycardia, follow these steps:
1. Treat per BRADYCARDIA PROTOCOL.

### Hypotension Management
For post-resuscitation hypotension, follow these steps:
1. Administer IV NORMAL SALINE BOLUS  
   - To Maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 if MAP Unavailable or Radial Pulses
2. EPINEPHrine PUSH DOSE  
   - Make 10 mcg/ml  
   - 10 mcg (1 ml) prn - slow push  
   - Titrate to effect  
   - To Maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 if MAP Unavailable or Radial Pulses  
   - May use up to 50 mcg (5 ml) per dose if needed

### No Post Arrest Anti-Arrhythmic Administered
1. Supportive Care Only
2. Anti-arrhythmic not necessary unless there is gross ventricular ectopy

### Additional Considerations
- If electrical conversion or anti-arrhythmic conversion was used, continue as indicated.
- If EKG and history support hyperkalemia as the cause, treat per HYPERKALEMIA protocol.
- Treat fever with cooling measures.

## Indications
* Respiratory arrest
* Cardiac arrest
* Return of pulse

## Signs and Symptoms
* Return of pulse

## Differential Diagnosis
* Continue to address specific differentials associated with the original dysrhythmia

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Neck, Skin, Lungs, Heart, Abdomen, Extremities, Neuro
* Most patients immediately post resuscitation will require ventilatory assistance.
* The condition of post-resuscitation patients fluctuates rapidly and continuously, and they require close monitoring.
* Appropriate post-resuscitation management can best be planned in consultation with Online Medical Control.
* This is the period of time between restoration of spontaneous circulation and the transfer of care at the emergency department. The focus is aimed at optimizing oxygenation and perfusion.
* Post resuscitation SVT should initially be left alone, but routinely monitor the patient. Follow NARROW COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA PROTOCOL or contact Medical Control.
* If the patient is profoundly bradycardic, refer to the BRADYCARDIA PROTOCOL and treat accordingly.
* Only administer oxygen if the patient is hypoxic with a SpO2 of 94 or less. Do not withhold oxygen from patients that are short of breath regardless of SpO2.
