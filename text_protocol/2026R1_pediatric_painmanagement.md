### Pain Scale

#### The Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale
Designed for children aged 3 years and older, the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale is also helpful for elderly patients who may be cognitively impaired. It offers a visual description for those who don't have the verbal skills to explain how their symptoms make them feel.

To use this scale, your doctor should explain that each face shows how a person in pain is feeling. That is, a person may feel happy because he or she has no pain (hurt), or a person may feel sad because he or she has some or a lot of pain.

#### A Numerical Pain Scale
A numerical pain scale allows you to describe the intensity of your discomfort in numbers ranging from 0 to 10 (or greater, depending on the scale). Rating the intensity of sensation is one way of helping your doctor determine treatment. Numerical pain scales may include words or descriptions to better label your symptoms, from feeling no pain to experiencing excruciating pain.

Some researchers believe that this type of combination scale may be most sensitive to gender and ethnic differences in describing pain.
