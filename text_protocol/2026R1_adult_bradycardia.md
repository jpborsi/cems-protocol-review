# Bradycardia

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Apply Cardiac Monitor
3. Oxygen
4. Capnography Procedure
5. IV / IO Procedure
6. Diagnostic EKG Procedure
    1. Look for ST Elevation - Transmit to ED
    2. Be prepared for decompensation
    3. Consider placing pacing pads
    4. Prepare medications
7. Continual Monitoring and Reassessment

   *If patient is stable, continue monitoring and preparation. If patient is unstable (hypotensive/symptomatic), proceed to the Unstable Patient pathway.*

### Unstable Patient Pathway
Criteria: Hypotensive / Symptomatic (SBP < 90 / No Radial Pulses / Altered Mental Status)

1. IV Normal Saline Bolus - To maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 if MAP unavailable or radial pulses
2. Epinephrine Push Dose:
    * Make 10 mcg/ml
    * 10 mcg (1 ml) prn – slow push
    * Titrate to effect
    * To maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 if MAP unavailable or radial pulses
    * May use up to 50 mcg (5 ml) per dose if needed
3. External Transcutaneous Pacing Procedure
4. Atropine 1 mg IV/IO q 3-5 min prn if working, max 3 mg
5. Consider sedation:
    * Midazolam 2.5 mg IV/IO or 5 mg IM/IN q 5 min prn – Max 10 mg
    * OR LORazepam 1–2 mg IV/IO/IM/IN q 10 min prn – Max 4 mg
    * If Midazolam or LORazepam unavailable, see medication section for Diazepam
6. Capnography Required
7. Consider hyperkalemia as cause and treat per Hyperkalemia protocol if EKG and history support the decision
8. Transport to appropriate facility
9. Contact receiving facility
10. Consult Medical Control where indicated
11. Appropriate transfer of care

### Stable Patient Pathway
Criteria: No hypotension, symptomatic bradycardia not present

1. Continue Monitoring and Reassessment
2. Be prepared for decompensation and have all treatment modalities immediately available if patient decompensates
3. Diagnostic EKG Procedure – Look for ST Elevation, Transmit to ED
4. Continue with preparation and reassessment
5. Transport to appropriate facility
6. Contact receiving facility
7. Consult Medical Control where indicated
8. Appropriate transfer of care

## Indications
* Bradycardia with or without symptoms
* Suspected or known bradyarrhythmias

## Signs and Symptoms
* HR < 60/min
* Chest pain
* Respiratory distress
* Hypotension or shock
* Altered mental status
* Syncope

## Differential Diagnosis
* Acute myocardial infarction
* Hypoxia
* Hypothermia
* Sinus bradycardia
* Athletes
* Head injury (elevated ICP) or stroke
* Spinal cord lesion
* Sick sinus syndrome
* AV blocks (1°, 2°, or 3°)

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Neck, Heart, Lungs, Neuro
* The use of Amiodarone in heart block can worsen bradycardia and lead to asystole.
* Treatment of bradycardia is based upon the presence or absence of hypotension.
* If hypotension exists, treat. If blood pressure is adequate, monitor only but have all treatment modalities immediately available if the patient decompensates.
* Transcutaneous pacing is the treatment of choice for Type II second-degree heart blocks and third-degree heart blocks.
* Transcutaneous pacing in demand mode will shut off if patient’s intrinsic heart rate rises above the set pacer rate.
* If the patient is critical and an IV is not established, initiate pacing. Use intranasal sedation if required.
* If the patient converts to another rhythm, refer to the appropriate protocol and treat accordingly.
* If bradycardia is a result of calcium channel blocker or beta blocker overdose, follow the Toxic Ingestion / Exposure / Overdose protocol.

### History
