# SYNCOPE / NEAR SYNCOPE

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. Consider SPINAL MOTION RESTRICTION
3. DIAGNOSTIC EKG PROCEDURE
    1. 1ST Contact to EKG and Transmission < 10 Min
4. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
5. AIRWAY PROTOCOL
6. OXYGEN / PULSE OXIMETRY PROCEDURE
7. BLOOD GLUCOSE PROCEDURE
8. IV PROCEDURE
9. Identify Treatable Causes
    1. Treat per Specific Protocol
        * Hypoxia – Treat per Airway / Breathing Protocols
        * Stroke CVA / TIA – Treat per Stroke Protocol
        * Overdose – Treat per Toxic Ingestion Protocol
        * Hypo / Hyperglycemia – Treat per Diabetic Protocol
        * Head Trauma – Treat per Head Trauma Protocol
        * Arrhythmia – Treat per Correct Arrhythmia Protocol
        * Psychiatric – Treat per Behavioral Emergencies
        * Sepsis – Treat per Septic Shock Protocol
        * Hypo / Hyperthermia – Treat per Specific Protocol
        * Hypotension – Treat per Specific Shock Protocols
        * Anaphylaxis / Allergic Reaction
        * Seizure – Treat per Seizure Protocol
10. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
11. CONTACT receiving facility
12. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated

### EKG Acquisition and Monitoring
1. Take cardiac monitor to patient’s side.
2. Apply cardiac monitor ASAP once on scene.
3. Maintain monitoring throughout transport including into hospital bed.

### EKG Patterns (High Risk)
If EKG pattern is identified, recognize these high-risk cardiac presentations:
* **Brugada EKG Pattern:**  
    * Type I: J wave amplitude ≥ 2mm, T wave Negative, ST-T configuration Coved type, ST segment (terminal portion) Gradually descending  
    * Type II: J wave amplitude ≥ 2mm, T wave Positive or biphasic, ST-T configuration Saddleback, ST segment Elevated ≥ 1mm  
    * Type III: J wave amplitude ≥ 2mm, T wave Positive, ST-T configuration Saddleback, ST segment Elevated  

* **S1Q3T3 EKG Pattern (High Risk for PE):**  
    * Lead I: Large S Wave Present  
    * Lead III: Q Wave Present  
    * Lead III: T Wave Inverted  

## Indications
* Syncope or Near Syncope in patients of ANY AGE indicates a temporary lack of perfusion to the brain.
* Return of patient to baseline after event still warrants evaluation and transport.
* Risk for future complications or death is high in many patients based on cause. 

## Signs and Symptoms
* Loss of consciousness / near loss of consciousness
* Dizziness / lightheadedness
* Palpitations
* Bradycardia / tachycardia
* Irregular pulse
* Hypo / hyperglycemia
* Hypotension
* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
* Pale
* Neuro deficits
* S1Q3T3 EKG pattern
* Brugada Syndrome EKG patterns

## Differential Diagnosis
* Vasovagal (BM, urination, coughing, GI stimulation)
* Cardiac (arrhythmia, MI, valve disorders)
* Drug / medication induced
* Orthostatic Hypotension
* Pulmonary embolism
* Hypoglycemia
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Dehydration
* Hypovolemia
* Stroke / TIA
* Anaphylaxis
* Seizure
* Autonomic failure (MS, Parkinson’s, DM, age, spinal cord injuries)
* Cardiac tamponade
* Aortic dissection
* Toxicological

## Key Points
* Required Exam: Mental Status, Skin, HEENT, Neck, Heart, Lung, Abdomen, Back, Extremities, Neuro
* Do not write off marginal vitals or findings as “normal”. These cases need to be evaluated in depth.
* History of preceding events is crucial to understanding cause. Determine onset, duration, LOC, patient recall of events, speed of recovery, neuro presentations, incontinence.
* Consider family history.
* Consider myocarditis if current or recent viral illness.
* Consider ectopic pregnancy if pregnancy known or suspected.
* CHF are extremely high-risk cases due to potential for arrhythmia.
* Pay attention to diagnostic EKG intervals, U waves, ectopic beats.
* Near syncope does not mean less risk.
* More than 25% of geriatric syncope is a cardiac arrhythmia.
* Syncope / near syncope patients should be transported even with identified and EMS treatable causes.

## Other Information
### HISTORY
* Onset, duration, event recall
* Cardiac (arrhythmias, MI, stents, CHF, myocarditis, long QT)
* Stroke / TIA
* Blood loss (internal, external, GI, rectal)
* Volume loss (sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, urination)
* Medications (compliance, new, changes, dose, types)
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Pregnancy or possibility (last menstrual period)
* Recent activity, event(s) preceding
* Seizure
* Fever
