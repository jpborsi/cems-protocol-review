# Cardiac Arrest (BLS)

## Overall Procedure

1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Identify Criteria for Death or DNR  
   - Refer to DOA Guidelines
   - Review DNR Comfort Care Guidelines
   - CONTACT ONLINE MEDICAL CONTROL if appropriate
3. Begin CPR Immediately
4. Attach Cardiac Monitor / Defibrillator / AED as soon as available
5. Deliver Shock x 1 if Shockable
6. Immediately Resume CPR – 2 minutes
7. Follow AED Prompts (if applicable)
8. Continue CPR  
   - Maintain CPR/Airway
   - Follow AIRWAY PROTOCOL
9. Identify known dialysis patients in asystole, V-Fib or pulseless V-Tach and contact Online Medical Control
10. IV/IO Procedure if indicated

#### Notes:
- At any time, if there is Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC), GO TO POST RESUSCITATION CARDIAC CARE.
- TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
- CONTACT receiving facility
- CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
- APPROPRIATE transfer of care

### Field Termination: ALS

**Criteria for Field Termination (ALS):**
1. Arrest not witnessed by EMS/first responders
2. Advanced Airway in Place
3. Vascular Access in Place
4. Continuous CPR During Resuscitation
5. At Least 2 Rounds of ACLS Medications
6. Asystole Confirmed in 2 leads or bradycardic wide complex PEA.
7. 20 Minutes of Resuscitation
8. An intra-arrest capnography reading <10 indicates no perfusion and may be helpful in considering termination of efforts.

- If ALS care available in field, patients in cardiac arrest SHOULD be worked on scene UNLESS special resuscitation circumstances exist that would benefit from hospital treatment unavailable in the field.

### Field Termination: BLS

**Criteria for Field Termination (BLS):**
1. Arrest not witnessed by EMS/first responders
2. No ROSC has been obtained after 20 min of CPR
3. Non-shockable rhythm

## Indications

* Unresponsive
* Apneic
* Pulseless

## Signs and Symptoms

* Unresponsive
* Apneic
* Pulseless

## Differential Diagnosis

* Medical vs. trauma
* V-fib vs. pulseless V-tach
* Asystole
* Pulseless electrical activity (PEA)

## Key Points

* Exam: Mental Status
* Always minimize interruptions to chest compressions.
* Success is based on proper planning and execution. Procedures require space and patient access, make room to work.
* Reassess airway frequently and with every patient move.
* Maternal arrest – Treat mother per appropriate protocol with immediate notification to Online Medical Control and rapid transport.
* When IV access failed or difficult, humeral head IO are preferred routes over tibial IO for resuscitation.
* If the patient converts to another rhythm, refer to the appropriate protocol and treat accordingly.
* Attempt to obtain patient history from family members or bystanders.
  - Estimated down time
  - Medical history
  - Complaints prior to arrest
  - Bystander CPR prior to EMS arrival
  - AED use prior to EMS arrival
* Administer Dextrose only if the patient has a blood glucose level < 70 mg/dl. Dextrose should be administered as soon as hypoglycemia is determined.
* Reassess the patient if the interventions do not produce any changes.
* If indicated, refer to the TERMINATION OF RESUSCITATION EFFORTS POLICY.
* If patient is pregnant and in cardiac arrest, manually manipulate the uterus to the left during CPR.
* If shockable rhythm and in an area with eCPR (ECMO CPR) capability at the receiving hospital, those eCPR guidelines for resuscitation and abbreviated field treatment may be followed. This requires specific training and education for the EMS agencies in the catchment area where these programs are being conducted.

## Other Information

Strongly encourage transport of resuscitated patient to facility with PCI where available.
