# Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI)

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Basic Maneuvers First  
    1. Open airway  
    2. Nasal / Oral Airway  
    3. Bag-Valve-Mask  
    4. Ventilate to maintain CAPNOGRAPHY and PULSE OXIMETRY  
    5. IV / IO procedure
3. Indications for Procedure (any of the following):
    1. SpO2 < 90% on high flow O2
    2. Respiratory rate < 10 or > 32
    3. Partial airway obstruction due to blood, secretions, trauma, or GCS less than 8
    4. Respiratory exhaustion or inevitable loss of the airway
4. Apply nasal cannula 15 LPM during intubation attempts
5. RSI Medication Administration:
    1. KETAMINE 1-2 mg/kg IV/IO (usual dose 100 mg)
        * If Ketamine unavailable, then ETOMIDATE 0.2–0.3 mg/kg IV/IO (usual dose 20 mg – No Repeat)
    2. ROCURONIUM 1 mg/kg IV/IO (usual dose 100 mg)  
        * If Rocuronium unavailable, then SUCCINYLCHOLINE 1–1.5 mg/kg IV/IO (average dose 100 mg, No Repeat)
        * See additional SUCCINYLCHOLINE warnings
6. Intubation Procedure:
    1. Maximum 2 Intubation Attempts  
        * Document failed attempt(s)
    2. If intubation unsuccessful, place Extraglottic (BIAD) Airway Device
7. Transport to appropriate facility, contact receiving facility, consult medical control where indicated, and perform appropriate transfer of care.

### Post Intubation Sedation
1. After 20 min or sooner if clinical signs of undersedation, as needed:
    1. KETAMINE 1 mg/kg IV/IO
    2. If Ketamine unavailable, then MIDAZOLAM 2.5 mg IV/IO OR LORazepam 1 mg IV/IO
2. Only if additional paralysis is needed:
    1. ROCURONIUM 1 mg/kg IV/IO (usual dose 100 mg)
3. If evidence of pain: fentaNYL 1 mcg/kg doses until pain tolerance prn
    * Caution: Paralysis lasts longer than induction/sedative agents
    * Re-dose ketamine (or benzodiazepine and fentanyl) at 20 min or sooner for signs of undersedation (Hypertension, Tachycardia, Facial Grimacing, Tearing, Wakefulness)

### Capnography Procedure
1. Required for all RSI procedures

## Indications
* SpO2 < 90% on high flow O2
* Respiratory rate < 10 or > 32
* Partial airway obstruction due to blood, secretions, trauma, or GCS 8 or less
* Respiratory exhaustion or inevitable loss of the airway

## Signs and Symptoms
* Gagging
* Audible stridor
* Change in skin color
* Decreased LOC
* Increased or decreased respiratory rate
* Labored breathing

## Differential Diagnosis
* Cardiac arrest
* Respiratory arrest
* Respiratory failure
* Anaphylaxis
* Esophageal obstruction

## Key Points
* Waveform Capnography is required before, during, and after intubation attempts. Ventilate to maintain Capnography and SpO2.
* Paralytics are never given alone. They are always preceded by an induction agent (hypnotic/sedative) such as Ketamine or Etomidate.
* Set up and test all equipment prior to intubation, including suction and back-up airways.
* Limit attempts post paralysis to 2, then use an extraglottic airway (King, LMA) if unsuccessful.
* Do not attempt RSI if the team is not able or trained to perform a cricothyrotomy.
* Once paralytics are administered, the airway must be managed from that point forward.
* Apply a nasal cannula to supply 15 LPM during intubation attempts to maintain oxygen saturation.
* Consider Mallampati grade to determine difficulty PRIOR to intubation attempt.
* A 30% change in HR or BP post procedure suggests light sedation; administer additional sedation.
* If Succinylcholine is used there is no repeat dosing; contraindicated with personal/family history of malignant hyperthermia, skeletal muscle myopathies, known/suspected hyperkalemia, and hypersensitivity to the medication.
* If patient becomes hyperthermic after Succinylcholine, notify receiving facility and initiate cooling measures.
* Larger doses of Succinylcholine may be required in myasthenia gravis.
* Ketamine preferred in asthmatic patients.
* RSI may cause cardiovascular collapse if attempted in hypotensive patients – resuscitate prior to RSI.

## Other Information

### Intubation Checklist

**Preparation**
* Pulse Ox & ECG monitor
* Functional IV with fluids attached – 2 optimal
* Appropriate medications drawn – each in own syringe; medication verified by second crew member
* Pre-oxygenation (NRB, BVM, or CPAP) 100% FiO2
* Position patient – towel roll behind head (not shoulders)
* Oxygen - BVM on source 1; Nasal Cannula on source 2
* Ensure enough O2 for extrication (if applicable)
* ETCo2 in-line detector connected, monitor initialized

**Procedural Equipment**
* Suction on and functioning
* Video laryngoscope – functioning, recording if capable
* Tube with intact pilot balloon
* 10 ml syringe
* Bougie
* Stylet as back up
* Stethoscope
* Commercial tube holder
* Wrist restraints

**Back-Up Plan**
* Prepare for hypotension (even if not in shock)
* IV fluids spiked and hung (not running unless needed)
* Prepare push dose epi
