# STROKE / CVA

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. AIRWAY PROTOCOL
3. OXYGEN
4. BLOOD GLUCOSE PROCEDURE
5. PATIENT ASSESSMENT
    1. Cincinnati Pre-Hospital Stroke Assessment (On Scene)
    2. Identify Last Time Known Normal - Record
    3. Identify Point of Contact for Last Known Normal; Obtain Phone Number - Record
    4. Determine if patient is on any anticoagulant medications. Record last dose and time if applicable.
    5. Relay Stroke Exam to Hospital
6. En-Route Procedures
    1. Conduct VAN+ Exam
    2. Move to Ambulance Rapid Transport
7. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
    1. CONSIDER THROMBECTOMY CAPABLE STROKE CENTER IF SYMPTOMS >4.5 HOURS or on Anti-Coagulants
    2. CONTACT receiving facility
    3. APPROPRIATE transfer of care
8. CONSULT Medical Direction where indicated
9. CONTINUE to monitor, reassess neurological deficit every 10 minutes and document findings
    1. Airway / Breathing
    2. Circulation / Shock

### Cincinnati Pre-Hospital Stroke Assessment (On Scene)
Criteria:
- Level of Consciousness: Awake and alert
- Facial Droop: Both sides move equally well on smile/grimace
- Motor—Arm Drift (eyes closed): Raised arms do not drift down (both together)
- Speech: Repeats "You can’t teach an old dog new tricks" using correct words and no slurring

If positive, proceed with further stroke evaluation.

### VAN+ Exam (En-Route)
Criteria:
- Deficits in face, arm, speech, or other stroke symptoms

1. Assess for:
    - Arm weakness
    - Vision
    - Gaze deviation or field cut
    - Aphasia: Expressive (Name watch or pen), Receptive (Follows commands)
    - Neglect: Ignore one side of body or sensory
2. If VAN Negative, assess Posterior Circulation: Ataxia
    - Ataxia Assessment: Finger to Nose, Heel to Shin
3. Communicate findings to ED Provider
    - If VAN Positive: Notify ED Provider
    - Move to assess Ataxia if VAN Negative

### Blood Pressure Management
1. If SBP > 220 or DBP > 120 (verified by 2 readings, in different 2 locations, at least 1 manual):
    - Administer LABETALOL 10 mg IVP SLOW over 2 min
    - Reassess in 10–15 mins and repeat LABETALOL only, 20 mg IVP SLOW if SBP > 220 or DBP > 120 persists

### IV Procedure
1. 2 Large Bore if Possible

### Mobile Stroke Program
- Cancel MSTU if Cincinnati is Negative – continue with transport to appropriate Stroke Hospital
- Cancel MSTU if response time will extend scene time greater than 10 min
- If MSTU continuing, continue with on scene treatment and extrication while waiting

### Capnography Procedure
- CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE

## Indications
* Suspected stroke or CVA as indicated by prehospital assessment tools

## Signs and Symptoms
* Altered mental status
* Weakness/paralysis
* Blindness or other sensory loss
* Aphasia
* Syncope
* Vertigo / dizziness
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Seizures
* Respiratory pattern change
* Hyper / hypotension

## Differential Diagnosis
* TIA (transient ischemic attack)
* Seizure
* Hypoglycemia
* Stroke
    * Thrombotic
    * Embolic
    * Hemorrhagic
* Tumor
* Trauma

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremities, Neuro
* Onset of symptoms is defined as the last witnessed time the patient was symptom free. (i.e., awakening with stroke symptoms would be defined as an onset time of the previous night when patient was symptom free)
* The differential diagnosis listed on the Altered Mental Status Protocol should also be considered.
* Elevated blood pressure is commonly present with stroke. Treat chest pain / discomfort per ACS protocol.
* Be alert for airway problems (swallowing difficulty, vomiting, diminished or absent gag reflex).
* Hypoglycemia can present as a localized neurological deficit, especially in the elderly.
* Patients who experience transient ischemic attack (TIA) develop most of the same signs and symptoms as those who are experiencing a stroke. The signs and symptoms of TIA’s can last from minutes up to one day. Thus, the patient may initially present with typical signs and symptoms of a stroke, but those findings may progressively resolve. The patient needs to be transported, without delay, to the most appropriate hospital for further evaluation.
* Document the time of onset for the symptoms, or the last time the patient was seen “normal” for them.
* Reassess neurological deficit every 10 minutes and document the findings. Evidence of neurological deficit includes confusion, slurred speech, facial asymmetry and focal weakness, coma, lethargy, aphasia, dysarthria, and seizure activity.
* Hypertensive emergencies are life threatening emergencies characterized by an acute elevation in blood pressure AND end-organ damage to the cardiac, CNS or renal systems. These crisis situations may occur when patients have poorly controlled chronic hypertension or stroke.
* Document pts GCS score.
* Check patient’s pupils and rule out head trauma.
* All symptomatic patients with hypertension should be transported with their head elevated.
* Hypertension can be a neuroprotective reflex in patients with increased intracranial pressure.

## Other Information
- Determine the following – Notify Receiving Hospital and Document:
    - Identify Last Time Known Normal and the Associated Clinical Story
    - Determine if patient is on any anticoagulant medications: Apixaban (Eliquis), Dabigatran (Pradaxa), Edoxaban (Savaysa), Fondaparinux (Arixtra), Rivaroxaban (Xarelto), Warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), Betrixaban (Bevyxxa)
- HISTORY:
    * Previous CVA, TIA's
    * Previous cardiac/vascular surgery
    * Associated diseases: diabetes, hypertension, CAD
    * Atrial fibrillation
    * Medications (blood thinners)
    * History of trauma
