Pre and Post-Partum

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. IV / IO PROCEDURE
3. QUIET RAPID TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
    1. CONTACT receiving facility
    2. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
    3. APPROPRIATE transfer of care
    4. Transport to Hospital with OB CAPABILITIES

### Pre-Eclampsia or Post-Partum Hypertension Sub-Procedure
#### REGARDLESS OF SYMPTOMS  
*(For SBP > 160 and/or DBP > 110, regardless of symptoms)*

1. MAGNESIUM SULFATE 4 grams IV/IO over 20 minutes  
    - May repeat 2 grams if unresolved or recurrence over 5 min
2. LABETALOL 20 mg slow IV  
    - If no improvement in 5 min, then 40 mg slow IV  
    - DO NOT CONFUSE WITH METOPROLOL
3. If patient actively seizing:
    - MIDAZOLAM 2.5 mg IV/IO or 5 mg IM/IN  
      **OR**
      LORazepam 1–2 mg IV/IO/IM/IN
        - If Midazolam or LORazepam Unavailable, See Medication Section for diazePAM
4. Capnography Procedure

#### With Symptoms and Lower BP Threshold  
*(For SBP > 140 and/or DBP > 90 with Edema, Headache, Visual Disturbances, or Epigastric Discomfort)*

1. MAGNESIUM SULFATE 4 grams IV/IO over 20 minutes  
    - May repeat 2 grams if unresolved or recurrence over 5 min
2. If SBP > 160 and/or DBP > 110 also give:
    - LABETALOL 20 mg slow IV  
      - If no improvement in 5 min, then 40 mg slow IV  
      - DO NOT CONFUSE WITH METOPROLOL

### Eclampsia Sub-Procedure
*(Patient Actively Seizing)*

1. MAGNESIUM SULFATE 4 grams IV/IO over 20 minutes  
   - May repeat 2 grams if unresolved or recurrence over 5 min
2. If seizures persist after all magnesium is used, administer:
    - MIDAZOLAM 2.5 mg IV/IO or 5 mg IM/IN  
      **OR**
      LORazepam 1–2 mg IV/IO/IM/IN
        - If Midazolam or LORazepam Unavailable, See Medication Section for diazePAM
3. Capnography Procedure
4. If SBP > 160 and/or DBP > 110 also give:
    - LABETALOL 20 mg slow IV  
      - If no improvement in 5 min, then 40 mg slow IV  
      - DO NOT CONFUSE WITH METOPROLOL

### OB Hemorrhage Note
- Can occur at the same time as OB Hemorrhage. See OB HEMORRHAGE EMERGENCIES. 

## Indications
* Pre-eclampsia or Post-partum hypertension (<6 weeks)
* Eclampsia (patient actively seizing)

## Signs and Symptoms
* Severe headache
* Visual changes
* Edema of hands and face
* Vaginal bleeding
* Abdominal pain
* Seizures
* Hypertension

## Differential Diagnosis
* Pre-eclampsia / eclampsia
* Placenta previa
* Placenta abruptio
* Spontaneous abortion

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Abdomen, Heart, Lungs, Neuro
* Any woman of child bearing age with syncope should be considered an ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise.
* May place patient in a left lateral position to minimize risk of supine hypotensive syndrome.
* Ask patient to quantify bleeding - number of pads used per hour.
* Any pregnant patient involved in a MVC should be seen immediately by a physician for evaluation and fetal monitoring.
* Pad do not DO NOT apply packing into the vagina. Save any expelled material and bring to hospital.
* Be alert for fluid overload when administering fluids.
* Consider starting a second IV if the patient is experiencing excessive vaginal bleeding or hypotension maintain BP 90 systolic.
* Transport to an appropriate OB facility.
* A delivered child should get another PCR as a second patient.

#### Pre-Eclampsia / Eclampsia Specific
* Severe headache, vision changes, or RUQ pain may indicate pre-eclampsia.
* In the setting of pregnancy, hypertension is defined as a BP greater than 140 systolic and greater than 90 diastolic, or a relative increase of 30 systolic and 20 diastolic from the patient's normal (pre-pregnancy) blood pressure.
* In cases of pre-eclampsia or post-partum hypertension, the labetalol is a priority. However, do not delay magnesium while obtaining orders for labetalol.

#### Uterine Rupture
* Often caused by prolonged, obstructed, or non-progressive labor.
* Severe abdominal pain.

#### Vaginal Bleeding
* If the patient is experiencing vaginal bleeding, DO NOT pack the vagina, pad on outside only.
* If shock or hypotension, go to the nearest hospital with OB capability.
* If no shock or hypotension and gestational age > 16 weeks and <35 weeks, transport to a sub-specialty obstetric hospital.
