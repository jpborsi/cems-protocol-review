# Toxic Inhalation - Carbon Monoxide

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol  
2. Known or Suspected Carbon Monoxide Poisoning  
3. Immediately remove from continued exposure  
    1. Avoid exertion to limit tissue oxygen demand  
    2. Determine exposure time  
4. Apply high flow oxygen  
    1. CPAP Procedure if CO >10%  
    2. Aggressive airway management with delivery of 100% oxygen can be lifesaving.  
    3. Supportive care with administration of oxygen alone has proven effective in a number of poisonings. It can also treat potential simultaneous CO exposure.  
5. Secure airway if comatose or compromised airway—follow AIRWAY PROTOCOL  
6. Pulse oximetry  
7. Pulse CO-oximetry (if available)  
8. Cardiac Monitoring Procedure  
9. IV / IO Procedure  
10. Draw blood sample for CO levels  
11. Transport to appropriate facility  
12. Contact receiving facility  
13. Consult Medical Control where indicated  
14. Appropriate transfer of care  
15. Capnography procedure  

### CO Levels Sub-Procedure
Describes assessment and subsequent considerations based on CO blood levels:

- <10% — Mild
- 10%-20% — Moderate
- >20% — Severe

Special considerations for pregnant females and children.

## Indications
* Inhalation of potentially carbon monoxide containing atmosphere
* Duration of exposure
* Reason (suicidal, accidental, criminal)

## Signs and Symptoms
* Malaise, fatigue, drowsiness
* Flu-like symptoms
* Headache
* Dyspnea
* Nausea / vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Dizziness
* Visual disturbances
* Memory disturbances
* Syncope
* Seizures
* Coma
* Incontinence

## Differential Diagnosis
* Flu / severe cold
* Chronic fatigue
* Migraine
* Myocardial infarction
* Diabetic emergencies
* Altitude sickness
* Ingested toxins
* Meningitis
* Hypothyroidism

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Skin, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremities, Neuro 
* Consider CO poisoning with any patient exposed to products of combustion.
* Causes and exposure may include malfunctioning gas appliances, vehicle exhaust, improper use of gas burning heaters, animal dung, environmental waste, and fires.
* Normal CO levels do not necessarily mean there was not CO poisoning. This is especially true if the patient has already received extensive oxygen therapy.
* Patients that show signs and symptoms at lower CO levels include pregnant females, infants, children, and the elderly.
* Vitals may be normal but could be tachycardic, hypo or hypertensive.
* Cherry red skin is rarely seen.
* PREGNANT patients are special circumstances as the affinity for fetal hemoglobin to carbon monoxide is very high and therapy including hyperbaric care is considered early on.
* Patients that demonstrate altered mental status may NOT sign refusals for treatment or transport.
* Known or suspected CO poisoning patients should receive high flow oxygen despite SpO2 readings.
* The use of a pulse oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning, as patients suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation level on a pulse oximeter.
* Pulse oximetry is still used on all CO poisonings as hypoxia in addition to the CO represents serious compounding respiratory issues possibly from other causes.
* Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin levels with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter.

## Other Information
* Special considerations for pregnant females and children: Pregnant patients are special circumstances as the affinity for fetal hemoglobin to carbon monoxide is very high and therapy including hyperbaric care is considered early on.
