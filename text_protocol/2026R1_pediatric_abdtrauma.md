# Pediatric Protocol: Abdominal Trauma

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Consider Spinal Motion Restriction Procedure
3. Pediatric Airway Protocol
4. Determine if Load & Go
5. Control Hemorrhage / Dress Wounds
    1. Pediatric Multiple Trauma Protocol if criteria met
6. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
7. Evisceration
    1. Cover, clean saline dressing to loosely stabilize
8. Penetrating Object
    1. Cover, clean saline dressing – Immobilize object
    2. If too large to transport – attempt to cut with care not to further injure tissue
9. Penetrating Wounds
    1. Cover, clean saline dressing
    2. Look for exit wound
10. Blunt Trauma
    1. Assess for change – distention
    2. Note mechanism
11. Monitor and Reassess
12. IV / IO PROCEDURE
    1. 20 ml / kg Normal Saline Bolus to maintain SBP
13. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
14. CONTACT receiving facility
15. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
16. APPROPRIATE transfer of care

### Trauma Alert Procedure
Criteria: If evidence of current / previous uncontrolled hemorrhage, sustained HR > 120 and / or SBP < 90 (for age), within 60 mins of injury.

1. INITIATE TRAUMA ALERT
2. Consider TRANEXAMIC ACID (TXA)
    1. 15 mg / kg mixed in 100 ml D5W over 10 mins – Max 1 gram

## Indications
* Abdominal trauma (Blunt or Penetrating mechanism)
* Pediatric patient as per weight or age protocols

## Signs and Symptoms
* Altered mental status
* Shock
* Distention
* Swelling
* Bulging
* Nausea and vomiting
* Bleeding
* Tenderness
* Pain
* Evisceration
* Discoloration
* Entrance / exit wounds

## Differential Diagnosis
* Not specifically listed in protocol

## Key Points
* Trauma to the abdomen is either Blunt or Penetrating. Blunt injuries are harder to detect and diagnose, and have a death rate twice that of penetrating wounds.
* Key signs and symptoms of blunt trauma include a patient in shock with no obvious injuries.
* Distention of the abdomen is an indication of internal hemorrhage. Pain may not be a significant factor.
* Many abdominal trauma injuries are Load & Go cases.
* Look for both an entrance and exit wound for all penetrating trauma, and treat accordingly.
* For all major trauma patients, the on scene time should be less than ten minutes.
* Fluid Resuscitate to systolic of 70 + 2 x age.
