# Trauma Arrest

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Bleeding / Hemorrhage Control Procedure
3. Spinal Motion Restriction Protocol
4. Airway Protocol
5. Begin Resuscitation
    1. Apply Cardiac Monitor
    2. Capnography Procedure
6. IV / IO Procedure (Appropriate Protocol based on Signs and Symptoms)
7. Initiate Trauma Alert
8. Transport to appropriate facility
9. Contact receiving facility
10. Consult Medical Control where indicated
11. Appropriate transfer of care

### DOA / Termination of Efforts Protocol
- Consider for Blunt Trauma Arrest Patients Who Do Not Respond to Treatment or Meet DOA Criteria or Penetrating Trauma Where the Patient Clearly Will Not Survive

### Bilateral Traumatic Needle Chest Decompression Procedure
- Bilateral Needle Decompression is indicated in cases of trauma that involve or may involve the abdomen or chest, it may be considered in other cases.

## Indications
* Unresponsive; not breathing
* Cardiac arrest
* Excessive bleeding
* Evidence of multi-trauma
* Significant mechanism of injury

## Signs and Symptoms
* Excessive bleeding
* Unresponsive; not breathing
* Evidence of multi-trauma

## Differential Diagnosis
* Obvious DOA
* Death

## Key Points
* Except for airway management, salvageable traumatic cardiac arrests are “load and go” situations.
* Resuscitation should not be attempted in trauma arrest patients with:
    1. Spinal transection
    2. Decapitation
    3. Total body burns
    4. Severe blunt trauma patients that are without vital signs
    5. Without pupillary response
    6. Without an organized or shockable cardiac rhythm at the scene
* Patients in cardiac arrest with deep penetrating cranial injuries and patients with penetrating cranial or truncal wounds associated with asystole and a transport time of more than 15 minutes to a definitive care facility are unlikely to benefit from resuscitative efforts.
* Extensive, time-consuming care of trauma victims in the field is usually not warranted. Unless the patient is trapped, they should be enroute to a medical facility within 10 minutes after arrival of the ambulance on the scene.
* Bilateral Needle Decompression is indicated in cases of trauma that involve or may involve the abdomen or chest, it may be considered in other cases.
