# CHEST TRAUMA

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. SPINAL MOTION RESTRICTION PROCEDURE
3. AIRWAY PROTOCOL
4. HIGH FLOW OXYGEN
5. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
6. IV / IO PROCEDURE
    1. 20 ml / kg Normal Saline Bolus to maintain SBP / Radial Pulses
    2. Fluid Resuscitate to systolic of 70 + 2 x age
7. If S&S of Tension Pneumothorax: TRAUMATIC NEEDLE CHEST DECOMPRESSION PROCEDURE
    1. Be Prepared to Repeat IF S&S Return
8. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
9. CONTACT receiving facility
10. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
11. APPROPRIATE transfer of care
12. INITIATE TRAUMA ALERT

### Flail Chest
1. Assist with Ventilation – Gentle Positive Pressure
2. LOAD AND GO

### Cardiac Tamponade
1. Assess for Beck’s Triad (Hypotension, + JVD and muffled heart sounds)
2. Paradoxical Pulse (no radial pulse when breathing in) is likely
3. LOAD AND GO

### Massive Hemothorax
1. Shock, then difficulty breathing
2. No JVD, decreased breath sounds, dull to percussion
3. LOAD AND GO

### Open Pneumothorax / Sucking Chest Wound
1. Occlusive dressing secured on three sides or Commercial Chest Seal, allowing air escape
2. Prepare for tension pneumothorax
3. LOAD AND GO

### Suspected: Traumatic Aortic Rupture, Tracheal or Bronchial Tree Injury, Myocardial Contusion, Diaphragmatic Tears, Esophageal Injury, Pulmonary Contusion
1. Ensure an Airway
2. Administer Oxygen
3. LOAD AND GO

### Evidence of Current/Previous Uncontrolled Hemorrhage, Sustained HR > 120 and/or SBP < 90 (for age), Within 60 Mins of Injury
1. Consider TRANEXAMIC ACID (TXA)
    1. 15 mg / kg mixed in 100 ml D5W over 10 mins – Max 1 gram

## Indications
* Pediatric patient with chest trauma

## Signs and Symptoms

### SIMPLE PNEUMOTHORAX
* Shortness of breath
* Dyspnea
* Tachypnea
* Cyanosis
* Chest pain
* Absent/diminished lung sounds on the affected side

### OPEN PNEUMOTHORAX
* Shortness of breath
* Dyspnea
* Cyanosis
* Sucking chest wound
* Shock
* Absent / diminished lung sounds on affected side

### TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX
* Shortness of breath
* Cyanosis
* Shock
* Absent / diminished lung sounds
* Tracheal deviation
* Hypotension
* JVD
* Tachycardia
* Dyspnea (late sign)

### HEMOTHORAX
* Shortness of breath
* Dyspnea
* Cyanosis
* Dullness to percussion sounds
* Flat neck veins
* Hypotension
* Shock
* Absent / diminished breath sounds
* Tachycardia

### CARDIAC TAMPONADE
* Hypotension
* Decreasing pulse pressure
* Elevated neck veins
* Muffled heart tones
* Bruising over the sternum
* Tachycardia

### TRAUMATIC ASPHYXIA
* Bloodshot, bulging eyes
* Blue, bulging tongue
* JVD
* Cyanotic upper body

### FLAIL CHEST
* Paradoxical chest wall movement
* Asymmetric chest movement upon inspiration
* Dyspnea
* Unstable chest segment
* Significant chest wall pain

## Differential Diagnosis
* Airway obstruction
* Flail chest
* Cardiac tamponade
* Massive hemothorax
* Open pneumothorax
* Tension pneumothorax
* Traumatic aortic rupture
* Esophageal injury
* Myocardial contusion
* Diaphragmatic tears
* Tracheal / bronchial tree injury
* Pulmonary contusion

## Key Points
* Thoracic injuries have been called the deadly dozen. The first six are obvious at the primary assessment.
    1. Airway obstruction
    2. Flail chest
    3. Cardiac tamponade
    4. Massive hemothorax
    5. Open pneumothorax
    6. Tension pneumothorax
* The second six injuries may be subtle and not easily found in the field:
    7. Traumatic aortic rupture
    8. Esophageal injury
    9. Myocardial contusion
    10. Diaphragmatic tears
    11. Tracheal / bronchial tree injury
    12. Pulmonary contusion
* A sucking chest wound is when the thorax is open to the outside. The occlusive dressing may be anything such as petroleum gauze, plastic, or a defibrillator pad. Tape only 3 sides down so that excess intrathoracic pressure can escape, preventing a tension pneumothorax. May help respirations to place patient on the injured side, allowing unaffected lung to expand easier.
* A flail chest is when there are extensive rib fractures present, causing a loose segment of the chest wall resulting in paradoxical and ineffective air movement. Positive pressure breathing via BVM will help push the segment and the normal chest wall out with inhalation and to move inward together with exhalation, getting them working together again. Do not use too much pressure to prevent additional damage or pneumothorax.
* A penetrating object must be immobilized by any means possible. If it is very large, cutting may be possible, with care taken not to move it about when making the cut. Place an occlusive and bulky dressing over the entry wound.
* A tension pneumothorax is life threatening, look for HYPOTENSION, unequal breath sounds, JVD, increasing respiratory distress, and decreasing mental status. The pleura must be decompressed with a needle to provide relief. Decompress between the 2nd and 3rd ribs, midclavicular placing the catheter over the 3rd rib. Alternate site, 5th intercostal space mid axillary or anterior axillary line. Once the catheter is placed, watch closely for re-occlusion. Repeat if needed to prevent re-occlusion. Use appropriately sized catheter for age.
