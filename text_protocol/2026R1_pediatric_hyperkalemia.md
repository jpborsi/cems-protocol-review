# Pediatric Protocol: Hyperkalemia

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. Apply pacing / defib pads prophylactically and prepare for decompensation
    1. Pacing may be ineffective until after pharmacologic treatments have been used
3. Patient Assessment
    1. Assess for history consistent with hyperkalemia
        - Available recent lab work
        - Missed dialysis
        - Kidney failure (consider causes - dehydration, failure to thrive)
        - Burns/Trauma
        - Uncontrolled diabetes/insulin deficiency
        - Addison’s Disease
        - Crush Injury/Compartment Syndrome
        - Medications (K+ sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, antibiotics, ARBs, NSAIDs, immunosuppressants)
        - Excessive potassium intake
    2. DIAGNOSTIC EKG PROCEDURE and Assess Vitals
    3. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
    4. Monitor lung sounds for fluid overload
4. Continue with further steps as necessary

### Management of EKG Changes

**Criteria:** Wide complex QRS, Peaked T waves, Bradycardia, or any combination. Suspected Hyperkalemia.

1. Flush IV then administer:
    - CALCIUM GLUCONATE 60 mg/kg (Max 3 g) IV over 10 min
      -or-
    - CALCIUM CHLORIDE 20 mg/kg IV/IO (Max 1 g)
    - May repeat either if available and EKG changes reoccur
    - DO NOT MIX IN THE SAME LINE AT SAME TIME
2. If EKG is SINE WAVE:
    1. Flush IV then administer SODIUM BICARBONATE 1 mEq/kg – IV/IO
        - May repeat if available and EKG changes reoccur
3. Serial Albuterol Treatments ONLY during entire transport:
    - ALBUTEROL 10mg (x4 2.5mg unit doses)
    - ALBUTEROL ONLY – NOT DUONEB
4. IV NORMAL SALINE BOLUS if signs of dehydration and no contraindications:
    - 20 ml/kg to maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 if MAP unavailable or radial pulses
5. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility, CONTACT receiving facility, CONSULT Medical Control where indicated, and ensure APPROPRIATE transfer of care

## Indications
* Wide complex QRS, Peaked T Waves, Bradycardia, or any combination, and suspicion of hyperkalemia
* History consistent with hyperkalemia
    - Missed dialysis
    - Kidney failure (dehydration, failure to thrive)
    - Burns/Trauma
    - Uncontrolled diabetes/insulin deficiency
    - Addison’s Disease
    - Crush Injury/Compartment Syndrome
    - Medications (K+ sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, antibiotics, ARBs, NSAIDs, immunosuppressants)
    - Excessive potassium intake

## Signs and Symptoms
* Peaked T-waves
    - Narrow and tall
    - Taller than 5 mm in the limb leads
    - Taller than 10 mm in the precordial leads
* Flattened P-waves
    - Widening of P-waves prior to their disappearance
    - Lack of P-waves can result in appearance of a junctional rhythm
* Prolonged PR Interval
* Widened QRS complexes
* Depressed ST-segment
* Sine waves
    - Broad QRS complex and tall T-wave
* AV blocks
* Ventricular dysrhythmias
    - Slower wide rhythms are often common with hyperkalemia
* Asystole
* Sinus bradycardia
* Wide complex unknown origin rhythms
* Bundle branch blocks

## Differential Diagnosis
* Sodium channel blocker OD
* Beta Blocker OD
* Calcium Channel Blocker OD
* STEMI
* V-tach

## Key Points
* A wide, fast, regular rhythm does not always equate to ventricular tachycardia. Remember that hyperkalemia can be a v-tach mimic.
* In cases where we have a great story for hyperkalemia, it is potentially beneficial to start resuscitation with the thought of treating hyperkalemia prior to standard ACLS.
* Certain medications traditionally used to treat ventricular tachycardia, such as amiodarone, can lose effectiveness in the presence of hyperkalemia.
* Calcium, whether chloride or gluconate, stabilizes the cardiac membrane and reduces myocardial irritability.
* Albuterol is a beta-adrenergic agonist that assists with the movement of potassium from the extracellular space into the intracellular space.
* While there is substantial evidence to limit the routine use of sodium bicarbonate in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and diabetic ketoacidosis, there is benefit in giving it in hyperkalemia.
* Focus less on the numerical value and more on the severity of symptoms based on the change rate of the potassium value.

## Other Information

**Stages of hyperkalemia and their potassium lab values:**
* Normal potassium levels: 3.5–5.5 mEq/L
* Mild hyperkalemia: 5.5–6.5 mEq/L
* Moderate hyperkalemia: 6.5–8.0 mEq/L
* Severe hyperkalemia: more than 8.0 mEq/L
