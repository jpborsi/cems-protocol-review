# Hyperkalemia

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. DIAGNOSTIC EKG PROCEDURE and Assess Vitals
3. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
4. CONTACT receiving facility
5. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
6. APPROPRIATE transfer of care
    1. Prophylactically apply pacing/defib pads and prepare for decompensation.
        - Pacing may be ineffective until after pharmacologic treatments have been used.
    2. Monitor Lung Sounds for Fluid Overload.
    3. AIRWAY PROTOCOL as appropriate.
    4. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE

### Management of EKG Changes or Suspected Hyperkalemia
Criteria: Presence of wide complex QRS or peaked T waves or bradycardia or any combination of these.

1. Flush IV, then administer either:
    - CALCIUM GLUCONATE 3 Grams IV/IO  
    - or CALCIUM CHLORIDE 1 GRAM IV/IO  
        - May repeat if available and EKG changes reoccur.
2. ALBUTEROL: Serial Albuterol Treatments Only During Entire Transport  
    - 10mg (x4 2.5mg Unit Doses)  
    - ALBUTEROL ONLY – NO IPRATROPIUM
3. DO NOT MIX CALCIUM AND BICARBONATE IN THE SAME LINE AT THE SAME TIME.

#### If EKG is Sine Wave
1. Flush IV, then:
    - SODIUM BICARBONATE 1 mEq/kg IV/IO  
      - May repeat if available and EKG changes reoccur.

#### If Signs of Dehydration and No Contraindications
1. IV NORMAL SALINE BOLUS  
    - 20 ml/kg to maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 if MAP unavailable or radial pulses.

### If EKG Wide or Becomes Sine Wave
- Treat immediately as above.

## Indications
* Wide complex QRS
* Peaked T waves
* Bradycardia
* History consistent with hyperkalemia
    - Missed Dialysis
    - Kidney Failure (Consider Causes - Dehydration, Failure to Thrive)
    - Burns / Trauma
    - Uncontrolled Diabetes / Insulin Deficiency
    - Addison’s Disease
    - Crush Injury / Compartment Syndrome
    - Medications (K+ Sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, Antibiotics, ARB’s, NSAIDS, Immunosuppressants)
    - Excessive Potassium Intake
    - Available Recent Lab Work

## Signs and Symptoms
* Peaked T-waves
    - Narrow and tall
    - Taller than 5 mm in the limb leads
    - Taller than 10 mm in the precordial leads
* Flattened P-waves
    - Widening of P-waves prior to their disappearance
    - The lack of P-waves can result in the appearance of a junctional rhythm
* Prolonged PR Interval
* Widened QRS complexes
* Depressed ST-segment
* Sine waves
    - Broad QRS complex and tall T-wave
* AV blocks
* Ventricular dysrhythmias
    - Slower wide rhythms are often common with hyperkalemia
* Asystole
* Sinus bradycardia
* Wide complex unknown origin rhythms
* Bundle branch blocks

## Differential Diagnosis
* Sodium channel blocker OD
* Beta Blocker OD
* Calcium Channel Blocker OD
* STEMI
* V-tach

## Key Points
* A wide, fast, regular rhythm does not always equate to ventricular tachycardia. Remember that hyperkalemia can be a v-tach mimic.
* In cases where we have a great story for hyperkalemia, it is potentially beneficial to start resuscitation with the thought of treating hyperkalemia prior to standard ACLS.
* Certain medications traditionally used to treat ventricular tachycardia, such as amiodarone, can lose effectiveness in the presence of hyperkalemia.
* Calcium, whether chloride or gluconate, stabilizes the cardiac membrane and reduces myocardial irritability.
* Albuterol is a beta-adrenergic agonist that assists with the movement of potassium from the extracellular space into the intracellular space.
* While there is substantial evidence to limit the routine use of sodium bicarbonate in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and diabetic ketoacidosis, there is benefit in giving it in hyperkalemia.
* Focus less on the numerical value and more on the severity of symptoms based on the change rate of the potassium value.

## Other Information

Stages of hyperkalemia and their potassium lab values:
* Normal potassium levels: 3.5–5.5 mEq/L
* Mild hyperkalemia: 5.5–6.5 mEq/L
* Moderate hyperkalemia: 6.5–8.0 mEq/L
* Severe hyperkalemia: more than 8.0 mEq/L
