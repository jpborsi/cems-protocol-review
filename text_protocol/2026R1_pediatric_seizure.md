# Pediatric Seizure Protocol

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. Position on side to prevent aspiration
    1. COOLING MEASURES (if febrile)
3. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
4. PEDIATRIC AIRWAY PROTOCOL
5. BLOOD GLUCOSE PROCEDURE
6. IV PROCEDURE (if evidence of shock or trauma)
7. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
8. CONTACT receiving facility
9. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
10. APPROPRIATE transfer of care

### Seizure Management Decision Tree

**Criteria:**  
- If febrile: Apply cooling measures.  
- If evidence of shock or trauma: Start IV procedure.
- Obtain blood glucose (BGL).
    - If BGL < 60: Treat per Pediatric Diabetic Emergencies Protocol.
    - If BGL > 60 and Active Seizure:
        1. Administer MIDAZOLAM: 0.05–0.1 mg/kg IV/IO q 5 min prn (Max Single Dose 2.5 mg; May Repeat Once – Max Total Dose 5 mg)
            -or-
            0.2 mg/kg IM/IN q 5 min prn (Max Dose 5 mg)
        2. OR LORazepam: 0.05–0.1 mg/kg slow IV/IO/IN q 5 min prn (Max Dose 2 mg)
            - Capnography Required
            - If Midazolam or LORazepam Unavailable, see Medication Section for Diazepam

### Airway and Cooling Sub-Procedure

- If febrile: Remove clothing and sponge with room temperature water.
- Be prepared to assist ventilations if a benzodiazepine such as LORazepam or MIDAZOLAM is used.

## Indications
* Reported seizure activity
* Observed seizure activity
* History of prior seizures
* History of recent head trauma
* Fever
* Congenital abnormality

## Signs and Symptoms
* Observed seizure activity
* Altered mental status
* Hot, dry skin or elevated body temperature

## Differential Diagnosis
* Fever
* Infection
* Head trauma
* Medication or toxin
* Hypoxia or respiratory failure
* Hypoglycemia
* Metabolic abnormality/acidosis
* Tumor

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Extremities, Neuro
* Status Epilepticus is defined as two or more successive seizures without a period of consciousness or recovery. This is a true emergency requiring rapid airway control, treatment, and transport.
* Grand mal seizures (generalized) are associated with loss of consciousness, incontinence, and tongue trauma.
* Focal seizures (petit mal) affect only a part of the body and are not usually associated with a loss of consciousness.
* Jacksonian seizures are seizures which start as a focal seizure and become generalized.
* Be prepared to assist ventilations especially if a benzodiazepine such as LORazepam or MIDAZOLAM is used.
* If evidence or suspicion of trauma, spine should be immobilized.
* If febrile, remove clothing and sponge with room temperature water.
* In an infant, a seizure may be the only evidence of a closed head injury.
* Older than 6 years and febrile, it is not considered a febrile seizure.
