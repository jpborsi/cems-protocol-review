1. Treat per Specific Protocol

### Shock Protocols
Criteria: If hypotension or signs of shock, proceed as follows.
1. Treat per Specific Shock Protocols

### Allergic Reaction Protocol
Criteria: If anaphylaxis or allergic reaction is identified, proceed as follows.

## Indications
* Unresponsive
* Decreased responsiveness
* Confusion
* Agitation
* Decreased mental status
* Inadequate respirations
* Change in baseline mental status

## Signs and Symptoms
* Unresponsive
* Decreased responsiveness
* Inadequate respirations
* Confusion
* Agitation
* Decreased mental status
* Change in baseline mental status
* Hypoglycemia (cool, diaphoretic skin)

## Differential Diagnosis
* Head trauma
* CNS (stroke, tumor, seizure, infection)
* Infection
* Shock (septic, metabolic, traumatic)
* Diabetes (hyper / hypoglycemia)
* Toxicologic
* Acidosis / alkalosis
* Environmental exposure
* Pulmonary (Hypoxia)
* Electrolyte abnormality
* Psychiatric disorder

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, HEENT, Skin, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Back, Extremities, Neuro
* Be aware of AMS as potential sign of an environmental toxin or Haz-Mat exposure and protect personal safety.
* It is safer to assume hypoglycemia than hyperglycemia if doubt exists.
* Do not let alcohol confuse the clinical picture.
* Low glucose (< 60), normal glucose (60 - 120), high glucose (> 250).
* Consider restraints if necessary for patient's and/or personnel's protection per the restraint procedure.
* Protect the patient airway and support ABCs.
* Document the patient’s Glasgow coma score pre and post treatment.
* Signs and symptoms of narcotic overdose include respiratory depression and altered mental status.
* Naloxone (Narcan) administration may cause the patient to go into acute opiate withdrawal, which includes vomiting, agitation, and/or combative behavior. Always be prepared for combative behavior.
* Naloxone (Narcan) may wear off in as little as 20 minutes causing the patient to become more sedate and possibly hypoventilate. Repeat dosing may be necessary. All A&O 4 patients having received Naloxone (Narcan) should be transported. If patient refuses transport, contact Online Medical Control before release.
* ONLY A FEW CAUSES CAN BE TREATED IN THE FIELD. CARE SHOULD FOCUS ON MAINTAINING AIRWAY AND RAPID TRANSPORT.
