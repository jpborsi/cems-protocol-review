# Pediatric Protocol: Toxic Ingestion / Exposure / Overdose

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Gather History:
    1. Ingestion or suspected ingestion of a potentially toxic substance
    2. Substance ingested, route, quantity
    3. Time of ingestion
    4. Reason (suicidal, accidental, criminal)
    5. Available medications in home
    6. Past medical history, medications
3. Patient Assessment:
    1. Assess Mental Status, Skin, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremities, Neuro
    2. Assess signs and symptoms
4. Bring bottles, contents, and emesis to Emergency Department.
5. If suspected Carbon Monoxide (CO) or Cyanide Poisoning, see specific protocol.
6. Continue with branch-specific interventions as below.
7. Transport to appropriate facility, assure appropriate transfer of care.
8. Contact receiving facility and consult Medical Control where indicated.

### Narcotic Overdose / AMS / Respiratory Depression

**Criteria:** AMS and/or respiratory depression with suspicion of narcotic/opiate ingestion/overdose.

1. Assure BLS ventilation with BVM.
2. Naloxone administration:
    - <br>1 mg IN atomized (may repeat every 2 min as necessary if obvious or suspected opiate OD until respiratory improvement or 12 mg max)
    - <br>0.1 mg/kg IV/IM/IN/IO (max 2 mg/dose)
3. Summon ALS if no response to IN dose.
4. If unresponsive to Naloxone, supply exhausted, or medication unavailable, consider advanced airway and hemodynamic support.
5. IV/IO procedure, blood glucose procedure, oxygen, capnography, airway protocol, diagnostic EKG, assess vitals.
6. Consider midazolam 0.05-0.1 mg/kg IV/IO q 5 min prn (max 2.5mg) or 0.2 mg/kg IM/IN q 5 min prn (max 5 mg), or lorazepam 0.05-0.1 mg/kg slow IV/IO/IN q 10 min prn (max 2mg). If midazolam or lorazepam unavailable, see medication section for diazepam.
7. If AMS regardless of BGL reading, dextrose 10% 5 ml/kg IV/IO (max 250 ml, may repeat prn). If dextrose 10% unavailable, see medication section for dextrose 50%.
8. Support hemodynamically, utilize shock protocol.
9. TAKE PPE PRECAUTIONS (gloves/mask minimum; contact/aerosol risk with fentanyl-based substances).

### Salicylate (ASA) Overdose (NOT Tylenol / Acetaminophen) / Sympathomimetic Overdose (Stimulants)

**Criteria:** Suspicion or evidence of ASA or stimulant ingestion/overdose.

1. If candidate for advanced airway:
    - Sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg SLOW IV/IO (max 50 mEq) prior to attempt.
2. Cooling measures if febrile.
3. If patient is tachypneic: Sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg SLOW IV/IO.
4. IV Normal Saline bolus 20 ml/kg.
5. If patient agitated or has chest pain, administer midazolam or lorazepam as above.
6. Diagnostic EKG procedure, assess vitals, and monitor for advanced airway needs.

### Organophosphates / Carbamates / Aerosol Exposure

**Criteria:** Suspected/known insecticide (organophosphate/carbamate) exposure.

1. Decontaminate and remove clothes if patient is exposed to any dangerous or noxious substances.
2. Assure proper decontamination BEFORE transport.
3. Atropine 0.05 mg/kg IV/IO (max 1 mg per dose), repeat every 3–5 minutes or as needed to control secretions (no max dose).
4. If wheezing, treat with aerosol albuterol/ipratropium (EMT use only with online medical control).
5. If AMS and normal (bad) or low respiratory rate: BVM and ventilatory rate to make CO₂ of 30.
6. Support hemodynamically, utilize shock protocol.
7. Consider advanced airway if necessary.

## Indications

* Ingestion or suspected ingestion of a potentially toxic substance
* AMS, respiratory depression, or suspected narcotic exposure
* Exposure to dangerous/noxious substances

## Signs and Symptoms

* Mental status changes
* Hypo/hypertension
* Decreased respiratory rate
* Tachycardia, dysrhythmias
* Seizures

## Differential Diagnosis

* Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)
* Acetaminophen (Tylenol)
* Depressants
* Stimulants
* Anticholinergic
* Cardiac medications
* Solvents, alcohols, cleaning agents
* Insecticides (organophosphates)
* Other organophosphates/carbamates

## Key Points

* Exam: Mental Status, Skin, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremities, Neuro
* Do not rely on patient history of ingestion, especially in suicide attempts.
* Bring bottles, contents, and emesis to ED.
* Tricyclic: 4 major areas of toxicity: seizures, dysrhythmias, hypotension, decreased mental status or coma; rapid progression from alert mental status to death.
* Acetaminophen: initially normal or nausea/vomiting. If not detected and treated, causes irreversible liver failure.
* Depressants: decreased HR, decreased BP, decreased temperature, decreased respirations, non-specific pupils.
* Stimulants: increased HR, increased BP, increased temperature, dilated pupils, and seizures.
* Anticholinergics: increased HR, increased temperature, dilated pupils, and mental status changes.
* Cardiac Medications: dysrhythmias and mental status changes.
* Solvents: nausea, vomiting, and mental status changes.
* Insecticides: increased or decreased HR, increased secretions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pinpoint pupils.
* Consider restraints if necessary for patient's and/or personnel's protection per the Restraint Procedure.
* If it can be done safely, take whatever container the substance came from to the hospital along with readily obtainable samples of medication unless this results in an unreasonable delay of transport.
* If applicable, DO NOT transport a patient to the hospital until properly decontaminated.
* Naloxone (Narcan) administration may cause the patient to go into acute opiate withdraw, which includes vomiting, agitation, and/or combative behavior. Always be prepared for combative behavior.
* Naloxone (Narcan) goal is to reverse life-threatening respiratory depression.
* Naloxone (Narcan) may wear off in as little as 20 minutes causing the patient to become more sedate and possibly hypoventilate. All A&O 4 patients having received Naloxone (Narcan) should be transported. If patient refuses transport, contact Online Medical Control before release.
