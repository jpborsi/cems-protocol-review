# EXTREMITY TRAUMA / AMPUTATION

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. BLEEDING / HEMORRHAGE CONTROL PROCEDURE
    1. Risk of Exsanguination? Internally or Externally
        * Upper Extremities: Apply Tourniquet
        * Lower Extremities: 2 Tourniquets if needed
3. OXYGEN
4. IV / IO PROCEDURE
5. PEDIATRIC PAIN MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL
6. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
7. CONTACT receiving facility
8. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
9. APPROPRIATE transfer of care

### Bleeding / Hemorrhage Control
**Criteria:** If there is a risk of exsanguination, internally or externally, follow these steps:
1. Upper Extremities – Apply Tourniquet
2. Lower Extremities – Apply 2 Tourniquets if needed

### Pediatric Pain Management Protocol
1. Follow protocol for analgesia in pediatric trauma.

### IV / IO and Medication Administration
**Open or suspected open fracture (crepitus/angulation with laceration over same site):**
1. CeFAZolin (ANCEF) 
    - Child 9 – 14 years (30 – 50 kg)
    - Over 14 or 50 kg use adult dose
    - 1 gram IV / IO in 100 ml D5 / NS over 10 min – No Repeat
2. Contraindications:
    - Allergy to cephalosporin antibiotics or penicillin
    - Unable to obtain allergy information for patient
    - Do not delay any other necessary procedure to administer
3. Monitor for signs of allergic reaction / anaphylaxis – treat per protocol if identified

**If evidence of current/previous uncontrolled hemorrhage, HR > 120 and/or SBP < 90, within 60 minutes of injury:**
1. Consider TRANEXAMIC ACID (TXA)
    - 15 mg/kg mixed in 100 ml D5W over 10 min – Max 1 gram

### Amputation
**If Amputation:**
1. Clean amputated part with normal saline irrigation
2. Wrap part in saline-soaked sterile dressing and place in plastic bag if able
3. Place on ice if available – no direct contact to tissue

## Indications
* Type of injury
* Mechanism: crush / penetrating / amputation
* Time of injury
* Open vs. closed wound / fracture
* Wound contamination
* Medical history
* Medications

## Signs and Symptoms
* Pain, swelling
* Deformity
* Altered sensation / motor function
* Diminished pulse / capillary refill
* Decreased extremity temperature

## Differential Diagnosis
* Abrasion
* Contusion
* Laceration
* Sprain
* Dislocation
* Fracture
* Amputation

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Extremity, Neuro
* In amputations, time is critical. Transport and notify medical control immediately, so that the appropriate destination can be determined.
* Hip dislocations and knee and elbow fracture / dislocations have a high incidence of vascular compromise.
* Urgently transport any injury with vascular compromise.
* Blood loss may be concealed or not apparent with extremity injuries.
* Lacerations must be evaluated for repair within 6 hours from the time of injury.

**Extremity Trauma**
* DO NOT take the time to splint injured extremities in major trauma patients unless it does not delay the scene time or prevents you from performing more pertinent patient care.
* Splint the extremity if the patient has signs and symptoms of a fracture or dislocation.
* Treat all suspected sprains or strains as fractures until proven otherwise.
* Splint the joint above and below for all suspected fractures.
* Splint the bone above and below for all suspected joint injuries.
* Check and document the patient’s MSP’s before and after splinting.
* A traction splint with a backboard is the preferred splint to use for femur fractures.

**Traumatic Amputation**
* Care of the amputated extremity includes:
    - Cleanse an amputated extremity with normal saline or sterile water.
    - DO NOT place any amputated tissue directly on ice or cold pack. Instead, place the amputated limb into a plastic bag. Put the bag into a container of cool water with a few ice cubes (if available).
* Contact the receiving hospital with the patient information and include the status of the amputated limb.
* Focus on patient care and not on the amputated extremity.
* Tourniquets should be applied early if there is a risk of exsanguination (bleeding out) from extremity injury.
* Remember to calm and reassure the patient. Do not give the patient or their family member’s false hope of re-attachment of the affected limb. A medical team at the receiving hospital makes this decision.
* Delegate someone to do an on-scene search for the amputated part when it cannot be readily found and continue with patient care.
* Use only commercially available tourniquets.
