# Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) / Pulmonary Edema

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
    1. Apply OXYGEN 100%
    2. Bag – Valve Mask
    3. Gentle Ventilation
2. Diagnostic EKG Procedure
    1. 1st Patient Contact to EKG < 10 Min
3. IV / IO Procedure
4. CAPNOGRAPHY Procedure
5. Continue with further steps as necessary:
    1. Consider CPAP Procedure (CPAP contraindicated with hypotension or untreated vomiting)
    2. If Wheezing: Albuterol / Ipratropium (EMT may administer only with proper training or ONLINE Medical Control)
    3. Monitor and Reassess
    4. Transport to appropriate facility
        - Contact receiving facility
        - Consult Medical Control where indicated
        - Appropriate transfer of care

### Management by Severity

#### Mild CHF / Pulmonary Edema (Adequate BP)
- Apply OXYGEN 100%
- Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg (400 mcg) SL – q 5 min
    - Do not give if SBP <110 or if patient took Erectile Dysfunction/Pulmonary Hypertension Drug within 48 hrs
- Monitor and Reassess

#### Moderate / Severe CHF / Pulmonary Edema (Adequate BP)
- Apply OXYGEN 100%
- Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg (400 mcg) SL THEN repeat q 5 min if SBP >120
    - Do not give if SBP <110 or if patient took Erectile Dysfunction/Pulmonary Hypertension Drug within 48 hrs
- Consider CPAP Procedure (contraindicated with hypotension or untreated vomiting)
- Monitor and Reassess

#### Cardiogenic Shock (Hypotensive)
- Apply OXYGEN 100%, Bag-Valve-Mask, Gentle Ventilation
- Do NOT Give Vasodilators
- Do NOT Apply ITD
- May consider application of CPAP with concurrent fluid bolus (if not contraindicated)
- Once BP corrected, monitor and reassess, refer to Cardiogenic Shock Protocol
- EPINEPHrine PUSH DOSE: Make 10 mcg/ml, 10 mcg (1 ml) prn - slow push, titrate to effect to maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 if MAP unavailable or radial pulses (may use up to 50 mcg / 5 ml per dose if needed)
- If HR is causing shock, see Specific HR Protocol
- Consider Intubation once BP corrected

## Indications
* Congestive heart failure / Pulmonary edema suspected

## Signs and Symptoms
* Respiratory distress, bilateral rales
* Apprehension, orthopnea
* Jugular vein distention
* Pink, frothy sputum
* Diaphoresis
* Hypotension, shock
* Chest pain
* Positive hepato-jugular reflux (HJR)
* Orthopnea

**Severity (Clinical Presentation):**
- **Mild**
    - Heart Rate: Normal range
    - Blood Pressure: Normal or slightly elevated
    - Breath Sounds: Bilateral rales, rhonchi, wheezing possible, some difficulty breathing
- **Moderate**
    - Heart Rate: Tachycardia
    - Blood Pressure: Elevated
    - Breath Sounds: Bilateral diffuse rales, wheezing possible, diminished, working hard to breath, frothy sputum may occur
- **Severe**
    - Heart Rate: Tachycardia then drops to bradycardia
    - Blood Pressure: Elevated HIGH then drops to Hypotension
    - Breath Sounds: May be ominously quiet, fatigued from work of breathing

## Differential Diagnosis
* Myocardial infarction
* Congestive heart failure
* Asthma
* Anaphylaxis
* Aspiration
* COPD
* Pleural effusion
* Pneumonia
* Pulmonary embolus
* Pericardial tamponade

**Differentiate CHF vs. Pneumonia:**

* Congestive Heart Failure Signs and Symptoms:
    - Afebrile
    - Jugular venous distension (JVD)
    - Positive hepato-jugular reflux (HJR)
    - Bilateral rales
    - Distal edema
    - Orthopnea
    - History of CHF

* Pneumonia Signs and Symptoms:
    - Febrile
    - Cough
    - History of infectious illness
    - Unilateral rales
    - No distal edema
    - No jugular venous distension (JVD)
    - No hepato-jugular reflux (HJR)

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Skin, Neck, Lung, Heart, Abdomen, Back, Extremities, Neuro
* Obtain diagnostic EKG to evaluate for M.I.
* Differentiate and document CHF vs. pneumonia.
* Monitor for hypotension after administration of Nitroglycerin.
* Monitor for hypotension while using CPAP, specifically with Nitroglycerin.
* DO NOT administer Nitroglycerin (Nitro-Stat) to a patient who took an erectile dysfunction (ED) medication – Sildenafil (Viagra), Tadalafil (Cialas), Vardenafil (Levitra), etc. or pulmonary hypertension medication (PHTN) within the last 48 hours. Ask all patients.

## Other Information
* Past Medical History: Congestive heart failure, medications (e.g., Digoxin [Lanoxin], Furosemide [Lasix]), cardiac history (past myocardial infarction), erectile dysfunction medication use, patient >75 years old.
