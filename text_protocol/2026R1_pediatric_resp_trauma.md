# TRAUMATIC BREATHING

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
    1. Evidence of Trauma – Blunt or Penetrating 
    2. Abnormal breath sounds, inadequate respiratory rate, unequal symmetry, diminished chest excursion, cyanosis
2. Jaw Thrust Airway Maneuver
3. Give High Flow Oxygen
4. Continue with further steps as necessary

### Sucking Chest Wound
1. Apply 3-sided Occlusive Dressing or Commercial Chest Seal

### Flail Chest
1. Assist with Ventilation – Gentle Positive Pressure

### Penetrating Object
1. Immobilize Object
2. Apply Sterile Saline Dressing

### If S&S of Tension Pneumothorax
Criteria: No lung sounds on affected side, Hypotension, JVD

1. TRAUMATIC NEEDLE CHEST DECOMPRESSION PROCEDURE  
    1. Be Prepared to Repeat IF S&S Return

### Transport and Communication
1. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
2. CONTACT receiving facility
3. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
4. APPROPRIATE transfer of care

## Indications
* Evidence of trauma (blunt or penetrating) with abnormal breath sounds, inadequate respiratory rate, unequal symmetry, diminished chest excursion, cyanosis

## Signs and Symptoms
* Abnormal breath sounds
* Inadequate respiratory rate
* Unequal chest symmetry
* Diminished chest excursion
* Cyanosis
* No lung sounds on affected side (for tension pneumothorax)
* Hypotension
* Jugular Venous Distension (JVD)
* Increasing respiratory distress
* Decreasing mental status

## Differential Diagnosis
* Airway/Breathing: Sucking chest wound, flail chest, tension pneumothorax, other causes of traumatic breathing difficulty
* Circulation/Shock: Hemorrhage, other trauma-related causes
* Trauma, Cardiac, Medical

## Key Points
* These injuries involve the airway and are life-threatening.
* Do not become distracted by non-life-threatening injuries that appear terrible.
* A sucking chest wound is when the thorax is open to the outside. The occlusive dressing may be anything such as petroleum gauze, plastic, or a defibrillator pad. Tape only 3 sides down so that excess intrathoracic pressure can escape, preventing a tension pneumothorax. It may help respirations to place patient on the injured side, allowing unaffected lung to expand easier.
* A flail chest is when there are extensive rib fractures present, causing a loose segment of the chest wall resulting in paradoxical and ineffective air movement. Positive pressure breathing via BVM will help push the segment and the normal chest wall out with inhalation and to move inward together with exhalation, getting them working together again. Do not use too much pressure, as to prevent additional damage or pneumothorax.
* A penetrating object must be immobilized by any means possible. If it is very large, cutting may be possible, with care taken to not move it while making the cut. Place an occlusive & bulky dressing over the entry wound.
* A tension pneumothorax is life threatening, look for HYPOTENSION, unequal breath sounds, JVD, increasing respiratory distress, and decreasing mental status. The pleura must be decompressed with a needle to provide relief. Use the intercostal space between the 2nd and 3rd ribs on the midclavicular line, going in on the top side of the 3rd rib. Alternate site, 5th intercostal space mid axillary or anterior axillary line. Once the catheter is placed, watch closely for re-occlusion. Be prepared to repeat decompression if signs of tension pneumothorax return. Use a 18-14-gauge needle, length based on the patient.
