# Pediatric Protocol: Bradycardia

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. PEDIATRIC AIRWAY PROTOCOL
3. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
4. IV / IO PROCEDURE
5. Patient Assessment:
    1. Assess for poor perfusion, decreased blood pressure, or respiratory insufficiency.

### Bradycardia Algorithm

#### If Poor Perfusion, Decreased B/P, or Respiratory Insufficiency Present

- **< 8 Years Old**
    1. If Heart Rate < 60:
        1. Start CPR.
        2. Administer EPINEPHrine 0.01 mg / kg IV / IO of 0.1 mg / ml concentration.
           - Repeat every 3–5 minutes.
           - Max 1 mg per dose.
           - Double check EPI concentration.
        3. Consider Atropine 0.02 mg / kg IV / IO.
           - Repeat every 3–5 minutes.
           - Minimum dose 0.1 mg.
           - Max dose 0.5 mg child / 1 mg adolescent.
        4. If HR unresolved with O2 / Compressions, consider External Transcutaneous Pacing.
        5. Any time pulses are lost, follow Pediatric Asystole / PEA Protocol.
    2. Transport to appropriate facility and contact receiving facility.
    3. Consult Medical Control where indicated.
    4. Monitor and reassess.
    5. Complete other indicated protocols.

- **> 8 Years Old**
    1. If Heart Rate < 60:
        1. Consider Atropine 0.02 mg / kg IV / IO.
           - Repeat every 3–5 minutes.
           - Minimum dose 0.1 mg.
           - Max dose 0.5 mg child / 1 mg adolescent.
        2. Administer EPINEPHrine 0.01 mg / kg IV / IO of 0.1 mg / ml concentration.
           - Repeat every 3–5 minutes.
           - Max 1 mg per dose.
           - Double check EPI concentration.
        3. Consider External Transcutaneous Pacing.
    2. Monitor and reassess.
    3. Complete other indicated protocols.

- **No Signs of Poor Perfusion, Decreased B/P, or Respiratory Insufficiency**
    1. Monitor and reassess.
    2. Complete other protocols as indicated.

## Indications
* Past medical history
* Foreign body exposure
* Respiratory distress or arrest
* Apnea
* Possible toxic or poison exposure
* Congenital disease
* Medication (maternal or infant)

## Signs and Symptoms
* Hypoxia
* Decreased heart rate
* Delayed capillary refill or cyanosis
* Mottled, cool skin
* Hypotension or arrest
* Altered level of consciousness
* Poor Perfusion
* Shock
* Short of breath
* Pulmonary fluid

## Differential Diagnosis
* Respiratory effort
* Respiratory obstruction
* Foreign body / secretions
* Croup / epiglottis
* Hypovolemia
* Hypothermia
* Infection / sepsis
* Medication or toxin
* Hypoglycemia
* Trauma

## Key Points
* Do Not Confuse EPINEPHrine 1 mg / ml and 0.1 mg / ml.
* Exam: Mental Status, HEENT, Skin, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Back, Extremities, Neuro.
* Heart Rate < 100 (Neonates).
* Heart Rate < 80 (Infants).
* Heart Rate < 60 (Children > 2 years).
* Infant = < 1 year of age.
* Most maternal medications pass through breast milk to the infant.
* Most pediatric arrests are due to airway problems.
* Hypoglycemia, severe dehydration and narcotic effects may produce bradycardia.
* Pediatric patients requiring external transcutaneous pacing require the use of pads appropriate for pediatric patients per the manufacturers’ guidelines.
* Identify and treat possible causes for pediatric bradycardia:
    1. Hypoxia
    2. Hypothermia
    3. Head injury
    4. Heart block
    5. Toxic ingestion / exposure
* Refer to pediatric reference material when unsure about patient weight, age and/or drug dosage.
* The minimum dose of Atropine that should be administered to a pediatric patient is 0.1 mg.
* If the rhythm changes, follow the appropriate protocol.
* Be sure of all medication doses, look it up in reference material.

## Other Information

* Weight-based pediatric size ranges:
    - 3-5 kg (6-11 lbs, 18-24 in)
    - 6-7 kg (13-15 lbs, 24-26 in)
    - 8-9 kg (18-20 lbs, 26-29 in)
    - 10-11 kg (22-24 lbs, 29-33 in)
    - 12-14 kg (26-31 lbs, 33-38 in)
    - 15-18 kg (33-40 lbs, 38-43 in)
    - 19-23 kg (42-51 lbs, 43-48 in)
    - 24-29 kg (53-64 lbs, 48-52 in)
    - 30-36 kg (66-81 lbs, 52-57 in)
