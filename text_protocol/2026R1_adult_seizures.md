## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Consider Spinal Motion Restriction
3. Airway Protocol
4. IV Procedure
5. Loosen Patient Clothing / Protect Patient
6. Monitor and Reassess
7. Capnography Procedure
8. Oxygen / Ventilate During Seizure Based On Capnography As Required
9. Check Blood Glucose Level
10. If BGL > 70 and Status Epilepticus?
    1. Administer MIDAZOLAM 2.5 mg IV/IO or 5 mg IM/IN – q 5 min prn – Max 10 mg OR LORazepam 1–4 mg IV/IO/IM/IN – q 5 min prn – Max 4 mg
    2. Capnography Required
    3. If Midazolam or LORazepam Unavailable, See Medication Section for DiazePAM
11. Diagnostic EKG Procedure
12. Refractory Seizure (After 2 doses of benzodiazepines)
    1. KETAMINE IV/IO – 100 mg diluted in 100 ml wide open -or- IM – 100 mg undiluted
    2. Consider repeat if no changes q 5 min
13. Transport to appropriate facility
14. Contact receiving facility
15. Consult Medical Control where indicated
16. Appropriate transfer of care

### Seizure Medication Administration
If patient is actively seizing and BGL > 70 and status epilepticus:
1. MIDAZOLAM: 2.5 mg IV/IO or 5 mg IM/IN – q 5 min prn – Max 10 mg
2. OR LORazepam: 1–4 mg IV/IO/IM/IN – q 5 min prn – Max 4 mg
3. If neither available, see medication section for DiazePAM.
4. Capnography required with these medications.

### Refractory Seizure
After two doses of benzodiazepines:
1. KETAMINE: IV/IO 100 mg diluted in 100 ml wide open, or IM 100 mg undiluted
2. Consider repeat dosing if no changes every 5 minutes

## Indications
* Reported/witnessed seizure activity
* Previous seizure history
* Medical alert tag information
* Seizure medications
* History of trauma
* History of diabetes
* History of pregnancy

## Signs and Symptoms
* Decreased mental status
* Sleepiness
* Incontinence
* Observed seizure activity
* Evidence of trauma

## Differential Diagnosis
* CNS (head) trauma
* Tumor
* Metabolic, hepatic, or renal failure
* Hypoxia
* Electrolyte abnormality (Na, Ca, Mg)
* Drugs, medications, non-compliance
* Infection/fever
* Alcohol withdrawal
* Eclampsia
* Stroke
* Hyperthermia

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Extremities, Neuro
* Status epilepticus is defined as two or more successive seizures without a period of consciousness or recovery. This is a true emergency requiring rapid airway control, treatment, and transport.
* Grand mal seizures (generalized) are associated with loss of consciousness, incontinence, and possibly tongue trauma.
* Focal seizures (petit mal) affect only a part of the body and are not usually associated with a loss of consciousness.
* For any seizure in a pregnant patient, follow the OB Emergencies Protocol and call Online Medical Control.
* Benzodiazepine administration is reserved for patients who are actively seizing only, not for prophylaxis of seizures.
* Be prepared to manage the airway and breathing of patients who have received benzodiazepines such as Lorazepam or Midazolam.
* Jacksonian seizures are seizures that start as a focal seizure and become generalized.
* Be prepared for airway problems and continued seizures.
* Assess possibility of occult trauma and substance abuse. Lorazepam is well absorbed when administered IM but takes up to 15 minutes to act. It should be given IV or intranasally (IN) with an atomizer.
* The seizure has usually stopped by the time the EMS personnel arrive and the patient will be found in the postictal state.
* There are many causes for seizures including epilepsy, head trauma, tumor, overdose, infection, hypoglycemia, and withdrawal. Be sure to consider these when doing your assessment.
* Routinely assess the patient’s airway.
* If the patient is combative and postictal, DO NOT use the Restraint Procedure before assessing for/treating hypoglycemia and hypoxia.
* If the patient is actively seizing, move any objects that may injure the patient. Protect, but do not try to restrain them.
