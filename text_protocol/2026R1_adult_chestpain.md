# Chest Pain

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. DIAGNOSTIC EKG PROCEDURE
    1. 1ST Contact to EKG and Transmission < 10 Min
3. OXYGEN / PULSE OXIMETRY PROCEDURE
4. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
5. IV PROCEDURE
6. Identify Causes
7. Treat Per Specific Protocol

### Airway / Breathing
Criteria:
- Hypoxia – Treat per Airway / Breathing Protocols
- Spontaneous Pneumothorax – Treat per Pain Management Protocol
- Sharp / Ripping / Tearing Pain – Treat Per Pain Management Protocol (No Aspirin)
- Chest Pain with Fever / Cough / Rhonchi – Treat per Pain Management Protocol

### Cardiac Medical
Criteria:
- Cardiac Chest Pain – Treat per Acute Coronary Syndrome Protocol
- GI / Esophageal Pain – Treat per Pain Management Protocol

### Circulation / Shock / Trauma
Criteria:
- Trauma – Treat per Traumatic Breathing Protocol

## Indications
* Chest pain (not all chest pain is cardiac in nature; a proper history and physical exam will help differentiate cause.)

## Signs and Symptoms
* CP (pain, pressure, aching, tightness)
* Location (substernal, epigastric, arm, jaw, neck, shoulder)
* Radiation of pain
* Pale, diaphoresis
* Shortness of breath
* Nausea, vomiting, dizziness

## Differential Diagnosis
* Angina vs. myocardial infarction
* Pericarditis
* Pulmonary embolism
* Asthma / COPD
* Pneumothorax
* Aortic dissection or aneurysm
* GE reflux or hiatal hernia
* Esophageal spasm
* Chest wall injury or pain
* Pleural pain

## Key Points
* Consider differential diagnosis points on all chest pain cases
* Treatment of non-cardiac chest pain with Aspirin / Nitroglycerine / Heparin / Ticagrelor may be harmful or deadly to the patient
* The history and physical exam often provides the most clues as to causation
* Diagnostic EKG’s are still indicated in all non-cardiac cases of chest pain
* Trauma trumps medical – if a patient sustained trauma as a result of a medical chest pain cause, the trauma is treated first.
* IV analgesia can be given in all cases of chest pain if indicated.

## Other Information
* The ACS Protocol and its agents (Aspirin, Nitro, Heparin, Brilinta) are only for cases suspected to be cardiac in nature
* HISTORY:
    * Age
    * Medications
    * Past medical history (MI, angina, diabetes)
    * Allergies
    * Recent physical exertion
    * Onset
    * Palliation / Provocation
    * Quality (crampy, constant, sharp, dull, etc.)
    * Region / Radiation / Referred
    * Severity (1-10)
    * Time (duration / repetition)
