# EXTREMITY TRAUMA / AMPUTATION

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. Patient Assessment
    1. Exam: Mental Status, Extremity, Neuro
3. Continue with further steps as necessary
    1. If evidence of current / previous uncontrolled hemorrhage, HR > 120 and / or SBP < 90, within 60 mins of injury:
        - Consider TRANEXAMIC ACID (TXA) 2 Grams (2000 mg) IV / IO slow push over 10 min -or- 2 Grams IV / IO (2000 mg) mixed in 100 ml D5W over 10 mins
    2. If open or suspected open fracture (Crepitus / angulation with laceration over same site):
        - CeFAZolin (ANCEF) 2 grams IV / IO in 100 ml D5 / NS over 10 min - No Repeat
            - Contraindications:
                - Allergy to cephalosporin antibiotics or penicillin
                - Unable to obtain allergy information for patient
            - Do not delay any other necessary procedure to administer
            - Monitor for signs of allergic reaction / anaphylaxis – treat per protocol if identified

### BLEEDING / HEMORRHAGE CONTROL PROCEDURE
1. Risk of Exsanguination? Internally or Externally
    1. Upper Extremities: Apply Commercial Tourniquet
    2. Lower Extremities: 2 Commercial Tourniquets
2. OXYGEN
3. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
4. CONTACT receiving facility
5. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
6. Appropriate transfer of care

### PAIN MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL
- Capnography required for sedation / pain management of trauma patient.

### AMPUTATION MANAGEMENT
If amputation:
1. Clean amputated part with normal saline irrigation.
2. Wrap part in saline soaked sterile dressing and place in plastic bag if able.
3. Place on ice if available – no direct contact to tissue.

### MULTIPLE TRAUMA CONSIDERATION
- Consider Multiple Trauma Protocol where indicated.

## Indications
* Extremity trauma or amputation.

## Signs and Symptoms
* Pain, swelling
* Deformity
* Altered sensation / motor function
* Diminished pulse / capillary refill
* Decreased extremity temperature

## Differential Diagnosis
* Abrasion
* Contusion
* Laceration
* Sprain
* Dislocation
* Fracture
* Amputation

## Key Points
* In amputations, time is critical. Transport and notify medical control immediately, so that the appropriate destination can be determined.
* Hip dislocations and knee and elbow fracture / dislocations have a high incidence of vascular compromise.
* Urgently transport any injury with vascular compromise.
* Blood loss may be concealed or not apparent with extremity injuries.
* Lacerations must be evaluated for repair within 6 hours from the time of injury.

### Extremity Trauma
* DO NOT take the time to splint injured extremities in major trauma patients unless it does not delay the scene time or prevents you from performing more pertinent patient care.
* Splint the extremity if the patient has signs and symptoms of a fracture or dislocation.
* Treat all suspected sprains or strains as fractures until proven otherwise.
* Splint the joint above and below for all suspected fractures.
* Splint the bone above and below for all suspected joint injuries.
* Check and document the patient’s MSP’s before and after splinting.
* A traction splint with a backboard is the preferred splint to use for femur fractures.

### Traumatic Amputation
* Care of the amputated extremity include:
    - Cleanse an amputated extremity with normal saline or sterile water.
    - DO NOT place any amputated tissue directly on ice or cold pack. Instead, place the amputated limb into a plastic bag. Put the bag into a container of cool water with a few ice cubes (if available).
* Contact the receiving hospital with the patient information and include the status of the amputated limb.
* Focus on patient care and not on the amputated extremity.
* Tourniquets should be applied early if there is a risk of exsanguination (bleeding out) from extremity injury.
* Remember to calm and reassure the patient. Do not give the patient or their family member’s false hope of re-attachment of the affected limb. A medical team at the receiving hospital makes this decision.
* Delegate someone to do an on-scene search for the amputated part when it cannot be readily found and continue with patient care.

## Other Information
* History
    - Type of injury
    - Mechanism: crush / penetrating / amputation
    - Time of injury
    - Open vs. closed wound / fracture
    - Wound contamination
    - Medical history
    - Medications
