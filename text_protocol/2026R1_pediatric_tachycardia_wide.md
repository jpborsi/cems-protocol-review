# Pediatric Protocol: Wide–Complex Tachycardia

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Cardiac Monitor
3. Attempt to Identify Cause
4. IV/IO Procedure
5. May attempt Vagal Maneuvers
    1. If no response in 1–2 minutes, may go directly to Synchronized Cardioversion
    2. If rhythm changes, go to appropriate protocol
6. If no response in 1–2 minutes, repeat synchronized cardioversion as needed (1–2 J/kg)
7. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
8. If signs of dehydration/hypoperfusion, administer IV Normal Saline Bolus 20 ml/kg (may repeat up to 3 times as required)
9. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility, CONTACT receiving facility, CONSULT Medical Control where indicated, appropriate transfer of care

### Stable (Signs of Perfusion)
* HR > 220 infant / HR >180 child

1. May attempt Vagal Maneuvers
2. Monitor and reassess
3. If rhythm changes, go to appropriate protocol

### Unstable (Signs of Hypoperfusion)
* HR > 220 infant / HR >180 child

1. May go directly to Synchronized Cardioversion (0.5–1 J/kg)
    1. Consider Sedation
        - Midazolam 0.05–0.1 mg/kg IV/IO q 5 min prn – Max dose 2.5 mg
        - Midazolam 0.2 mg/kg IM/IN q 5 min prn – Max dose 5 mg
        - OR Lorazepam 0.05 mg/kg slow IV/IO/IN q 10 min prn – Max dose 2 mg
        - If Midazolam or Lorazepam unavailable, see medication section for Diazepam
        - Capnography required
2. Repeat SYNCHRONIZED CARDIOVERSION as needed (1–2 J/kg)
3. If unstable rhythm persists:
    1. IV Normal Saline Bolus 20 ml/kg if signs dehydration/hypoperfusion (may repeat up to 3 times as required)
    2. Amiodarone 5 mg/kg IV/IO (mix in 100 ml D5 over 20–60 min, max dose 300 mg)
       - If Amiodarone unavailable, see medication section for Lidocaine

## Indications
* Pediatric patient with wide–complex tachycardia
* Stable (signs of perfusion) or unstable (signs of hypoperfusion) rhythm
* HR > 220 in infants or HR > 180 in children

## Signs and Symptoms
* Respiratory distress
* Syncope or near syncope
* HR: Child > 180 bpm / Infant > 220 bpm
* Pale or cyanosis
* Diaphoresis
* Tachypnea
* Vomiting
* Hypotension
* Altered level of consciousness
* Pulmonary congestion
* Syncope

## Differential Diagnosis
* Heart disease (congenital)
* Hypo-/hyperthermia
* Hypovolemia or anemia
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Anxiety / pain / emotional stress
* Fever / infection / sepsis
* Hypoxia
* Hypoglycemia
* Medication / toxin / drugs (see HX)
* Pulmonary embolus
* Trauma
* Tension pneumothorax

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Skin, Neck, Lung, Heart, Abdomen, Back, Extremities, Neuro
* Carefully evaluate the rhythm to distinguish Sinus Tachycardia, Supraventricular Tachycardia, and Ventricular Tachycardia
* Separating the child from the caregiver may worsen the child's clinical condition
* Pediatric paddles should be used in children < 10 kg
* Monitor for respiratory depression and hypotension associated if Lorazepam or Midazolam is used
* Continuous pulse oximetry is required for all SVT Patients if available
* Document all rhythm changes with monitor strips and obtain monitor strips with each therapeutic intervention
* Possible causes of tachycardia: hypoxia, hypovolemia, fear, and pain
* A complete medical history must be obtained
* Do not delay cardioversion to gain vascular access for the unstable patient
* If you are unable to get the monitor to select a low enough joule setting, contact Online Medical Control
* If the patient is stable, do not cardiovert
* Record 3-Lead EKG strips during adenosine administration
* Perform a diagnostic EKG prior to and after medication conversion or cardioversion of SVT
* If the rhythm changes, follow the appropriate protocol

## Other Information
* Fluid Resuscitate to systolic of 70 + 2 x age
* HISTORY
    - Past medical history
    - Medications or toxic ingestion (Aminophylline, diet pills, thyroid supplements, decongestants, digoxin)
    - Drugs (nicotine, cocaine)
    - Congenital heart disease
