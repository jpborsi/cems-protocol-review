# Pediatric Trauma Arrest

## Overall Procedure
1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. BEGIN RESUSCITATION
3. CONSIDER SPINAL MOTION RESTRICTION PROCEDURE
4. IV / IO PROCEDURE
5. Apply Cardiac Monitor
6. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE
7. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility
8. CONTACT receiving facility
9. CONSULT Medical Control where indicated
10. APPROPRIATE transfer of care
11. INITIATE TRAUMA ALERT
    1. Airway / Breathing
    2. Circulation / Shock
    3. Trauma
    4. Cardiac
    5. Medical

### Bilateral Traumatic Needle Chest Decompression
If indicated by clinical findings of tension pneumothorax in traumatic arrest.

1. Perform bilateral traumatic needle chest decompression as indicated.

### Consider DOA / Termination of Efforts
Criteria:
- Cardiac arrest patients with spinal transection, decapitation, or total body burns.
- Obvious, severe blunt trauma patients that are without vital signs, pupillary response, or an organized or shockable cardiac rhythm at the scene.
- Cardiac arrest with deep penetrating cranial injuries or penetrating cranial or truncal wounds associated with asystole and a transport time of more than 15 minutes to a definitive care facility.

## Indications
* Cardiac arrest
* Unresponsive; not breathing
* Evidence of multi-trauma
* Excessive bleeding
* Significant mechanism of injury

## Signs and Symptoms
* Unresponsive; not breathing
* Cardiac arrest
* Excessive bleeding
* Evidence of multi-trauma
* Significant mechanism of injury
* Obvious DOA
* Death

## Differential Diagnosis
* Trauma cardiac arrest due to:
    * Blunt trauma
    * Penetrating trauma

## Key Points
* Immediately transport traumatic cardiac arrest patients.
* With the exception of airway management, traumatic cardiac arrests are “load and go” situations.
* Resuscitation should not be attempted in cardiac arrest patients with spinal transection, decapitation, or total body burns, nor in patients with obvious, severe blunt trauma patients that are without vital signs, pupillary response, or an organized or shockable cardiac rhythm at the scene. Patients in cardiac arrest with deep penetrating cranial injuries and patients with penetrating cranial or truncal wounds associated with asystole and a transport time of more than 15 minutes to a definitive care facility are unlikely to benefit from resuscitative efforts.
* Extensive, time-consuming care of trauma victims in the field is usually not warranted. Unless the patient is trapped, they should be enroute to a medical facility within 10 minutes after arrival of the ambulance on the scene.
* Blood pressure is a late and unreliable indicator of shock in children.
