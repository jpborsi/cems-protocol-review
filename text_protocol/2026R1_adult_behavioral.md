# BEHAVIORAL / AGITATION / COMBATIVE

## Overall Procedure

1. UNIVERSAL PATIENT CARE PROTOCOL
2. Scene Safety
    1. SUMMON LAW ENFORCEMENT
    2. Constant reassessment of ABC’s, personal, and patient safety
3. Patient Assessment
    1. Assess for treatable medical emergencies such as hypoxemia, sepsis, seizure, encephalitis, hypoglycemia, or stroke.
    2. Treat suspected problems per appropriate protocol (AMS, overdose, head trauma, hypoglycemia).
    3. Remove patient from stressful environment.
    4. BLOOD GLUCOSE PROCEDURE
4. Verbal techniques (Reassurance, calm, establish rapport)
5. Classify Patient Agitation:
    1. Agitation – Not Combative
    2. Combative – not Violent (Risk to Self or others)
    3. Combative – Violent (Significant Threat to Providers)
6. Administer medications and initiate physical restraint as indicated (see sub-procedures below).
7. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE Required with use of certain medications.
8. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility, CONTACT receiving facility, CONSULT Medical Control where indicated, and ensure APPROPRIATE transfer of care.
    1. Transport Restrained or Medicated patients supine or in lateral positions only – Never Prone.

### Agitation – Not Combative

Criteria: Patient is experiencing a period of high anxiety seemingly from a psychiatric event not otherwise treatable by EMS, who is not a threat to self or others.

1. diphenhydrAMINE 25 - 50 mg IV/IM – No Repeat
    1. May Give Prophylactically
    2. Do not mix HALOPERIDOL or DroPERidol and diphenhydrAMINE in the same syringe - Incompatible
2. If extrapyramidal symptoms occur after antipsychotic injection: treat as indicated.
3. Treat suspected problems per appropriate protocol.

### Combative – Not Violent

Criteria: Patient is a threat to self or others and can be controlled and restrained with appropriate help without significant risk to providers.

1. HALOPERIDOL 5 mg IM ONLY  
   OR  
   DroPERidol 5 mg IM ONLY  
   (Either: Over Age 65 Give 2.5 mg; IM ONLY – No Repeat)
2. RESTRAINT PROCEDURE (see below)
3. May use diphenhydrAMINE if extrapyramidal symptoms occur.
4. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE Required

### Combative – Violent

Criteria: Patient is in a violent state that puts providers at significant risk despite appropriate help.

1. RESTRAINT PROCEDURE (see below)
2. KETAMINE 250 mg IM (USE 100 mg/ml Concentration)  
   May Repeat 250 mg IM Only in 5 Min if NO RESPONSE – Max 500 mg
3. If signs of emergence after KETAMINE:
    1. MIDAZOLAM 2.5 mg IV/IO or 5 mg IM/IN q 5 min prn – Max 10 mg  
       OR  
       LORazepam 1–2 mg IV/IO/IM/IN q 10 min prn – Max 4 mg
    2. If Midazolam or LORazepam unavailable, see Medication Section for diazePAM
    3. AEMT use requires prior agency MD approval and training
    4. CAPNOGRAPHY PROCEDURE Required
4. Notify receiving physician Ketamine administered so patient presentation is not misconstrued as other etiology.

### Combative/Agitated, Suspected Psychosis

1. OLZANzapine Orally Disintegrating Tablet 10 mg Oral – No Repeat (With Psychosis patient only; instead of Midazolam)
2. Do not use Midazolam or LORazepam and OLZANzapine together.

### Restraint Procedure

Criteria for Restraint Use:
- Patient out of control and may cause harm to self or others – document these in PCR.
- Necessary force required for patient control without causing harm.
- Position of patient must not impede airway or breathing.
- Restraints must not impede circulation.
- Place mask on patient for body secretion protection. May use surgical mask, or Non-rebreather if patient needs oxygen.
- Use supine or lateral positioning ONLY. Never Prone.
- MSP checks are required every 15 min.
- DOCUMENT methods used.
- Medication should be used in conjunction with physical restraint when available.

## Indications

* Situational crisis
* Psychiatric illness / medications
* Injury to self or threats to others

## Signs and Symptoms

* Anxiety, agitation, confusion
* Affect change, hallucinations
* Delusional thoughts, bizarre behavior

* See Altered Mental Status differential diagnosis

## Differential Diagnosis

* Alcohol Intoxication
* Toxin / substance abuse
* Medication effect / OD
* Withdrawal syndromes
* Depression
* Bipolar (manic-depressive)
* Schizophrenia
* Anxiety disorders

## Key Points

* Exam: Mental Status, Skin, Heart, Lungs, Neuro
* All psychiatric patients must have medical clearance at a hospital ED before transport to a mental health facility.
* Your safety first!
* Be sure to consider all possible medical / trauma causes for behavior. (Hypoglycemia, overdose, substance abuse, hypoxia, head injury, seizure, etc.)
* Do not irritate the patient with a prolonged exam.
* Do not overlook the possibility of associated domestic violence or child abuse.
* The safety of on-scene personnel is the priority. Protect yourself and others by summoning law enforcement to assure everyone’s safety and if necessary, to enable you to render care. Do not approach the patient if he/she is armed with a weapon. Once restrained assure that the patient is searched for weapons.
* Consider the medical causes of acute psychosis. Causes may include head trauma, hypoglycemia, acute intoxication, sepsis, CNS insult, and hypoxia.
* Suicide ideation or attempts must be transported for evaluation.
* Be alert for rapidly changing behaviors.
* Limit patient stimulation and use de-escalation techniques.
* If the patient has been placed in handcuffs by a law enforcement agency, then a member from that agency MUST ride with the patient in the ambulance to the hospital.
* Consider treatment of agitation / anxiety combativeness for patients requiring restraint procedure.
* Use of Ketamine and / or Midazolam for behavioral emergencies by AEMTs requires training and approval from the agency's Medical Director before they can use the medications off-line.
* Ketamine use in pregnancy is a risk / benefit assessment per case. Consult Medical Control if there are questions.
* Patients who have used stimulant drugs or have struggled with law enforcement may be at increased risk of metabolic acidosis.
* Rapid / deep breathing or respiratory distress may be indicative of metabolic acidosis.
* Transport to facilities with appropriate police / security.
