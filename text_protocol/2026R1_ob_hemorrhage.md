# Obstetrical Hemorrhage Emergencies (Pre and Post-Partum)

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. IV / IO Procedure
3. Quiet, rapid transport to appropriate facility
    1. Contact receiving facility
    2. Consult Medical Control where indicated
    3. Appropriate transfer of care
    4. Transport to hospital with OB capabilities

### Obstetrical Hemorrhage Emergency Management

1. Capnography Procedure
2. Normal Saline Bolus
    * To maintain MAP > 65 or SBP 90 if MAP unavailable or radial pulses
3. External Uterine Massage (when indicated)
4. Oxytocin 10 Units IM – No Repeat
    * Do NOT give between multiple births
    * Permissible to give PRIOR to placental delivery
5. If evidence of current/previous uncontrolled hemorrhage, HR > 120 and/or SBP < 90, consider Tranexamic Acid (TXA)
    * 1 gram (1000 mg) IV/IO slow push over 10 min
      - or -
    * 1 gram IV/IO (1000 mg) mixed in 100 ml D5W over 10 min
    * May repeat in 30 min if bleeding continues

#### Bleeding During Pregnancy
* 1st Trimester – Miscarriage, Ectopic Pregnancy
* 2nd & 3rd Trimester – Placenta Previa / Abruptio Placenta
    * Pad, do not pack bleeding, save, and bring with patient

#### Bleeding After Birth
* Postpartum Hemorrhage (Up to 12 weeks postpartum)
    * Can occur at the same time as OB Hypertension  
      (See OB Hypertensive Emergencies Protocol)

## Indications
* Any woman of childbearing age with syncope
* Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy or postpartum
* Abdominal pain, hemodynamic instability, or shock in pregnancy
* Postpartum blood loss greater than 300-500 ml

## Signs and Symptoms
* Vaginal bleeding
* Abdominal pain
* Seizures
* Hypertension
* Severe headache
* Visual changes
* Edema of hands and face

## Differential Diagnosis
* Pre-eclampsia / Eclampsia
* Placenta previa
* Placenta abruptio
* Spontaneous abortion
* Ectopic pregnancy
* Pelvic inflammatory disease
* Uterine inversion
* Uterine rupture
* Postpartum hemorrhage

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Abdomen, Heart, Lungs, Neuro
* Any woman of childbearing age with syncope should be considered an ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise.
* May place patient in a left lateral position to minimize risk of supine hypotensive syndrome.
* Ask patient to quantify bleeding — number of pads used per hour.
* Any pregnant patient involved in a motor vehicle collision should be seen immediately by a physician for evaluation and fetal monitoring.
* Pad only — DO NOT apply packing into the vagina. Save any expelled material and bring to hospital.
* Be alert for fluid overload when administering fluids.
* Consider starting a second IV if the patient is experiencing excessive vaginal bleeding or hypotension. Maintain BP 90 systolic.
* Transport to an appropriate OB facility.
* A delivered child should get another PCR as a second patient.

## Other Information

### Abortion / Miscarriage
* The patient may be complaining of cramping, nausea, and vomiting.
* Be sure to gather any expelled tissue and transport it to the receiving facility.
* If patient is < 16 weeks, may go to any hospital. If > 16 weeks, or unknown, transport to sub-specialty obstetrical hospital.
* Signs of infection may not be present if the abortion/miscarriage was recent.
* An abortion is any pregnancy that fails to survive over 20 weeks. When it occurs naturally, it is commonly called a “miscarriage”.

### Abruptio Placenta
* Usually occurs after 20 weeks.
* Dark red vaginal bleeding.
* May only experience internal bleeding.
* May complain of a “tearing” abdominal pain.

### Ectopic Pregnancy
* The patient may have missed a menstrual period or had a positive pregnancy test.
* Acute unilateral lower abdominal pain that may radiate to the shoulder.
* Any female of childbearing age complaining of abdominal pain is considered to have an ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise.
* If > 16 weeks, transport to a sub-specialty obstetric hospital.

### Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
* Be tactful when questioning the patient to prevent embarrassment.
* Diffuse back pain.
* Possibly lower abdominal pain.
* Pain during intercourse.
* Nausea, vomiting, or fever.
* Vaginal discharge.
* May walk with an altered gait due to abdominal pain.

### Placenta Previa
* Usually occurs during the last trimester.
* Painless.
* Bright red vaginal bleeding.

### Postpartum Hemorrhage
* Post-partum blood loss greater than 300 - 500 ml.
* Bright red vaginal bleeding.
* Be alert for shock and hypotension.

### Uterine Inversion
* The uterine tissue presents from the vaginal canal. Cover with sterile saline dressing.
* Be alert for vaginal bleeding and shock.

### Uterine Rupture
* Often caused by prolonged, obstructed, or non-progressive labor.
* Severe abdominal pain.

### Vaginal Bleeding
* If the patient is experiencing vaginal bleeding, DO NOT pack the vagina, pad on outside only.
* If shock or hypotension, go to the nearest hospital with OB capability. If no shock or hypotension and gestational age > 16 weeks and < 35 weeks, transport to a sub-specialty obstetric hospital.

*THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM TRAUMA DOSING*
*Evidence based dosing for this patient population*
