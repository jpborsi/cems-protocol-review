# Pediatric Protocol: Diabetic Emergencies

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Blood Glucose Procedure
3. IV / IO Procedure
4. Patient Assessment
5. If Glucose < 60 OR Glucose > 250:
    1. Transport to appropriate facility
    2. Contact receiving facility
    3. Consult Medical Control where indicated
    4. Appropriate transfer of care

### Oral Glucose Administration
- Criteria: Patient is alert and can swallow.
1. Administer Oral Glucose 7.5 – 18.75 g (1/2 Tube)
2. May repeat as needed.
3. Check for hypotension, tachycardia, poor cap refill.
4. Recheck blood glucose.

### IV / IO Administration
- For patients requiring IV/IO access and unable to take oral glucose.
1. DEXTROSE 10%: 5 ml/kg IV/IO, max 250 ml

### Glucagon Administration
- If no IV / IO access:
1. If < 20 kg: 0.5 mg IM q 15 min prn if no response (Max 2 mg)
2. If > 20 kg: 1 mg IM q 15 min prn if no response (Max 2 mg)
    - AEMT may administer only with proper training.
    - Long time to onset of action.

### Fluid Resuscitation (for Circulation/Shock)
1. NORMAL SALINE 10 ml/kg bolus over 60 minutes
2. Fluid resuscitate to systolic of 70 + 2 x age

## Indications
* Known diabetic, medic alert tag
* Past medical history
* Medications
* Recent BGL

## Signs and Symptoms

### Hypoglycemia
* Altered level of consciousness
* Dizziness
* Irritability
* Diaphoresis
* Convulsions
* Hunger
* Confusion

### Hyperglycemia
* Altered level of consciousness / coma
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea / vomiting
* Dehydration
* Frequent thirst and urination
* General weakness / malaise
* Hypovolemic shock
* Hyperventilation
* Deep / rapid respirations

## Differential Diagnosis
* ETOH
* Toxic overdose
* Trauma
* Seizure
* Syncope
* CNS disorder
* Stroke
* Tumor (Hypoglycemia)
* Pre-existing condition (Hypoglycemia)
* Diabetic ketoacidosis (Hyperglycemia)

## Key Points

### Hyperglycemia
* Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) is a complication of diabetes mellitus. It can occur when insulin levels become inadequate to meet the metabolic demands of the body for a prolonged amount of time (onset can be within 12 - 24 hours). Without enough insulin the blood glucose increases, and cellular glucose depletes. The body removes excess blood glucose by dumping it into the urine. Pediatric patients in DKA should be treated as hyperglycemic under the Pediatric Diabetic Emergencies Protocol.
* Patients can have Hyperglycemia without having DKA.

### Hypoglycemia
* Always suspect Hypoglycemia in patients with an altered mental status.
* If a blood glucose analysis is not available, a patient with altered mental status and signs and symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia should receive Dextrose, or Glucagon.
    * Dextrose is used to elevate BGL but it will not maintain it. The patient will need to follow up with a meal, if not transported to a hospital.
* If the patient is alert and can swallow; consider administering oral glucose, have patient drink orange juice with sugar or a sugar containing beverage, or have the patient eat a candy bar or meal.
* Check the patient's BGL after the administration of Dextrose, Glucagon, or after any attempt to raise the patient's BGL.

### Miscellaneous
* If IV access is successful after Glucagon IM and the patient is still symptomatic, Dextrose should be administered.
* Glucagon unlikely to be useful in malnourished patients.
