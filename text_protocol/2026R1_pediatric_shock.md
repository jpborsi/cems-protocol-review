# Pediatric Protocol: Shock

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Apply Cardiac Monitor and Assess Vitals
3. Airway Protocol
4. Capnography Procedure
5. Blood Glucose Procedure
6. Continue with further steps as necessary
    1. Consider all possible causes of shock and treat per appropriate protocol.
    2. Monitor lung sounds for fluid overload when administering IV fluids.
    3. Routinely reassess the patient and provide supportive care.
    4. Transport to appropriate facility, contact receiving facility, consult Medical Control where indicated, transfer care as appropriate.

### Anaphylactic Reaction / Shock
If history, symptoms, or exam suggest anaphylaxis OR moderate/severe allergic reaction, proceed here.

#### Criteria for Path Selection:
- Mild: Rash, itching, no difficulty breathing or throat tightening, BP normal
- Moderate/Severe: Rash, itching, airway compromise, wheezing, swelling, GI symptoms, hypotension, radial pulses present
- Impending Arrest/Anaphylactic Shock: No radial pulses, severe hypotension, any age, decreased LOC, airway compromise

1. Oxygen
2. Remove offending agent if present
3. Diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg slow IV/IM/IO (No repeat, Max 50 mg)
4. Epinephrine administration per weight and intervention level:
    1. <30 kg: 0.15 mg IM or Auto-Injector JR q 5 min prn
    2. >30 kg: 0.3 mg IM or Auto-Injector q 5 min prn
    3. For moderate/severe, may repeat after 5 min if no improvement
    4. EMT may draw and administer IM only with proper training
5. Methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg IV/IO/IM (No repeat, Max 125 mg)
6. Albuterol nebulized 2.5 mg if wheezing (EMT use only with online medical control)
7. IV/IO Normal Saline bolus 10-20 ml/kg, may repeat up to 3 times as required
8. Secure airway and ventilate for airway compromise or impending arrest

### Hypovolemic, Neurogenic, Cardiogenic, and Septic Shock
Proceed based on specific suspected etiology. Monitor and treat based on clinical evidence and history.

1. IV/IO Normal Saline bolus 10-20 ml/kg, may repeat up to 3 times as required (Hypovolemic/Neurogenic/Septic)
2. For Cardiogenic Shock: IV/IO Normal Saline bolus 10 ml/kg, max 500 ml, monitor for fluid overload
3. Blood glucose procedure
4. Consider spinal motion restriction if indicated (particularly for neurogenic shock)
5. Contact Medical Control for use of vasopressors if fluid bolus fails
6. Epinephrine push dose: Mix 1 mg/1 ml in 100 ml D5 or NS to make 10 mcg/ml; administer 1 mcg/kg, max 10 mcg/dose every 2-5 min, titrate to effect
7. For Adrenal/Addisonian Crisis: Administer patient-prescribed IV steroids if available (preferred), otherwise methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg IV/IM/PO (No repeat, Max 125 mg)
8. For Septic Shock: Consider methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg IV/IO/IM/PO, No repeat, Max 125 mg)

#### Push Dose Epinephrine Preparation
1. Mix 1 mg epinephrine (1 mg/ml) in 100 ml D5 or Normal Saline; this makes 10 mcg/ml concentration.
2. Shake bag well to mix.
3. Draw from bag and administer 1 mcg/kg (max 10 mcg/1 ml per dose), titrate to effect.

## Indications
* Trauma
* Infection
* Dehydration
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Fever
* Congenital heart disease
* Medication or toxin exposure
* Signs and symptoms of shock
* Suspected anaphylaxis or severe allergic reaction (systemic involvement)

## Signs and Symptoms
* Hypotension
* Tachycardia
* Weak, thready pulse
* Narrow pulse pressure
* Pale, cool, clammy, or dry skin
* Dyspnea
* Respiratory distress
* Wheezing
* Stridor
* Hoarseness
* Cyanosis
* Facial or airway edema
* Urticaria/hives
* Restlessness, confusion, weakness, dizziness
* Delayed capillary refill
* Altered level of consciousness or coma
* Decreased urine output
* Irritability
* Warm burning feeling, itching, rhinorrhea
* Pulmonary edema
* Compromise in neurological function (neurogenic)
* Normal or flushed skin (neurogenic)
* Febrile (septic)
* Signs of infection/history of UTI
* Dehydration (septic)

## Differential Diagnosis
* Urticaria (rash only)
* Anaphylaxis (systemic effect)
* Shock (vascular effect)
* Angioedema (drug-induced)
* Aspiration/airway obstruction
* Vasovagal event
* Asthma
* Trauma
* Infection
* Dehydration
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Fever
* Congenital heart disease
* Medication or toxin

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Skin, HEENT, Heart, Lung, Abdomen, Extremities, Back, Neuro
* Decreasing heart rate is a sign of impending collapse
* Most maternal medications pass through breast milk to the infant (e.g., narcotics, benzodiazepines)
* Ensure use of appropriately sized BP cuff
* Primary assessment findings should alert to shock: mental status, tachycardia, skin color, capillary refill
* Shock is not only caused by blood loss. Evaluate for fluid loss from other causes such as excessive vomiting, diarrhea, heat exposure, and malnutrition.
* Do not use only the patient’s blood pressure in evaluating shock – also look for lower body temperature, poor capillary refill, decreased LOC, increased heart rate, and poor skin color or turgor.
* Fluids: Fluid resuscitate IF HYPOTENSIVE to systolic of 70 + 2 x age
* Do not confuse epinephrine 1 mg/ml (IM) and 0.1 mg/ml (IV)
* Addisonian Crisis/Adrenal Crisis is not a field diagnosis; use patient-supplied steroids before EMS-supplied if available.
* Monitor for dehydration and/or severe vomiting, stabbing abdominal/back/leg pain, low BP (shock), low blood sugar, loss of consciousness in addisonian crisis. Administer emergent IV steroids as indicated.
* SIRS Checklist: Temp > 38.3C (100.9F) or < 36C (96.8F); HR > 90; RR > 20 or Capnography < 32 mmHg; altered mental status; SBP < 90 or MAP < 70; need for CPAP.
* Severe Sepsis: SBP < 90; SpO2 < 90; no urine output last 8 hours; prolonged bleeding from gums; lactate > 4.
