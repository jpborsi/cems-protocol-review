# Acute Coronary Syndrome

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Patient Assessment
3. IV / IO Procedure – Consider 2nd IV if STEMI
    1. All chest pain patients must have an IV and diagnostic EKG.
    2. Strongly encourage transport to hospital with interventional cath lab (PCI) when STEMI is present on diagnostic EKG – Initiate STEMI Alert.
    3. Contact receiving facility.
    4. Consult Medical Control where indicated.
    5. Appropriate transfer of care.
4. Aspirin
    1. 324 mg chew and swallow (81 mg / tab x4) – No Repeat
    2. If the patient took a dose of Aspirin that was less than 324 mg in the last 24 hours, then additional Aspirin can be administered to achieve a therapeutic dose of 324 mg.
    3. Aspirin can be administered to a patient on Coumadin (Warfarin) unless the patient’s physician has advised them otherwise.
5. Diagnostic EKG Procedure - LEFT 
    1. Look for ST Elevation - Transmit to ED
    2. EKG indicates STEMI - Consult Physician if unsure
6. If unremarkable LEFT EKG and presentation consistent with MI:
    1. Diagnostic EKG Procedure – RIGHT (V4R)
    2. Do not delay transport to acquire right sided diagnostic EKG
    3. Assure adequate IV and BP before nitroglycerine if right sided infarction
7. Do not routinely give OXYGEN unless SpO2 <94% - may treat SOB
8. If nausea / vomiting, treat per Nausea / Vomiting Protocol
9. Continue with other treatment between nitroglycerin doses

### STEMI Pathway
Criteria: EKG indicates STEMI (ST elevation in two or more contiguous leads), or as confirmed by Paramedic or Online Medical Control.

1. Transmit to ED and initiate STEMI alert.
2. Complete checklist before administering Ticagrelor or Heparin.
3. Consider fentanyl 25 – 100 mcg IV/IO/IM/IN q 10 min prn – 200 mcg max, if needed for pain.
    1. If fentanyl is unavailable, see Medication Section for Morphine Sulfate.
    2. Routine use of opiate pain control discouraged if Ticagrelor being utilized – interferes with absorption.
    3. In trauma with ACS treat only with fentanyl.
4. Ticagrelor (Brilinta): 180 mg Chew and Swallow PO – No Repeat (Do not administer if already on antiplatelets or if cocaine/stimulant induced STEMI. See Key Points and checklist.)
5. Heparin: 60 Units/kg IV/IO, Max Dose 4000 Units – No Repeat (Do not administer if already on anticoagulants or if cocaine/stimulant induced STEMI. Must have preexisting directive from Medical Director for off-line use.)
6. Nitroglycerin (Nitro-Stat): 0.4 mg (400 mcg) SL (If SBP >110 with IV or SBP >120 without IV), q 5 min prn up to 3 doses.
    1. Do not administer if erectile dysfunction/pulmonary HTN drug use within 48 hrs.
    2. EMT use requires On-Line Medical Control.
7. If cocaine or stimulant Induced STEMI: Treat per Toxic Ingestion / Exposure / Overdose – Sympathomimetic Overdose (Stimulants) Column.
8. If trauma/CPR/post arrest: Do not administer Ticagrelor or Heparin.

### Ischemic Chest Pain (No STEMI on EKG)
Criteria: No STEMI on EKG.

1. Transport to appropriate facility (PCI).
2. Contact receiving facility.
3. Consult Medical Control where indicated.
4. Repeat nitroglycerin per dosing guideline if SBP >110 with IV or >120 without IV, up to 3 doses (same restrictions as above).
5. Consider fentanyl for pain relief as above.
6. If nausea/vomiting, treat per Nausea/Vomiting Protocol.

## Indications
* Acute coronary syndrome or ischemic chest pain
* Patient with chest pain, pressure, aching, tightness, or equivalent symptoms as related to possible myocardial infarction (MI)

## Signs and Symptoms
* Chest pain (pain, pressure, aching, tightness)
* Location (substernal, epigastric, arm, jaw, neck, shoulder)
* Radiation of pain
* Pale, diaphoresis
* Shortness of breath
* Nausea, vomiting, dizziness

## Differential Diagnosis
* Trauma vs. medical
* Angina vs. myocardial infarction
* Pericarditis
* Pulmonary embolism
* Asthma/COPD
* Pneumothorax
* Aortic dissection or aneurysm
* GE reflux or hiatal hernia
* Esophageal spasm
* Chest wall injury or pain
* Pleural pain

## Key Points
* Make the scene safe: All chest pain patients must have an IV and diagnostic EKG.
* Exam: Mental Status, Skin, Neck, Lung, Heart, Abdomen, Back, Extremities, Neuro.
* If patient has taken Nitroglycerin without relief, consider potency of the medication.
* If positive ECG changes, establish a second IV while enroute to the hospital.
* Monitor for hypotension after administration of Nitroglycerin or FentaNYL.
* Nitroglycerin or FentaNYL may be repeated per dosing guidelines in the MEDICATIONS SECTION.
* Diabetics / geriatric patients often have atypical pain, vague, or only generalized complaints. Be suspicious of a “silent MI”.
* Refer to the BRADYCARDIA PROTOCOL (HR < 60 bpm) or NARROW COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA PROTOCOL (HR > 150 bpm) if indicated.
* If the patient becomes hypotensive from Nitroglycerin, FentaNYL administration, place the patient in the Trendelenburg position and administer a Normal Saline bolus.
* Be prepared to administer Narcan if the patient experiences respiratory depression due to FentaNYL administration.
* If pulmonary edema is present, refer to the CHF / ACUTE PULMONARY EDEMA PROTOCOL. Consider other causes of chest pain such as aortic aneurysms, pericarditis, esophageal reflux, pneumonia, pneumothorax, costochondritis, pleurisy, pancreatitis, appendicitis, cholecystitis (gallbladder), and pulmonary embolism.
* Aspirin can be administered to a patient on Coumadin (Warfarin) unless the patient’s physician has advised them otherwise.
* If the patient took a dose of Aspirin that was less than 324 mg in the last (24) hours, then additional Aspirin can be administered to achieve a therapeutic dose of 324 mg.
* DO NOT administer Nitroglycerin (Nitro-stat) to a patient who took an erectile dysfunction medication; Sildenafil (Viagra), Tadalafil (Cialas), Vardenafil (Levitra), etc. within the last 48 hours due to potential severe hypotension.
* Nitroglycerin (Nitro-stat) can be administered to a patient by EMS if the patient has already taken their own prior to your arrival. Document it if the patient had any changes in their symptoms or a headache after taking their own Nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin can be administered to a hypertensive patient complaining of chest discomfort without Medical Control permission.
* Nitroglycerin can be administered without an IV if patient has a BP greater than 120 mmHg.
* DO NOT treat PVC’s with Amiodarone unless patient develops runs of V-Tach or has sustained V-tach.
* Pulse oximetry is not an indicator of myocardial perfusion.
* Only administer oxygen if the patient is hypoxic with a SpO2 of less than 94. Do not withhold oxygen from patients that are short of breath regardless of SpO2.
* Once applied to a known or suspected ACS patient do not remove a diagnostic EKG, even if the initial EKG is unremarkable. Some devices continue to look for ST segment changes and will alert if there are changes.
* Consider repeat diagnostic EKG if condition changes or lengthy transport.
