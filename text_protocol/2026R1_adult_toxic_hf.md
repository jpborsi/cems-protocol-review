# Toxic Exposure: Hydrogen Fluoride Exposure

## Overall Procedure
1. Assure proper decon has been performed prior to patient contact.
2. Remove patient from continued exposure – CALL FOR HAZ-MAT RESPONSE.
3. Assess for potential exposure with signs/symptoms consistent with exposure.
4. Assure adequate airway, ventilation and oxygenation. Secure airway against secretions.
5. Continue with further steps as necessary:
    1. Establish 2 large bore IV’s in non-exposed areas if possible.
    2. 20 ml / kg Normal Saline if hypotensive.
    3. TRANSPORT to appropriate facility.
    4. CONTACT receiving facility NOTIFY of HAZ-MAT Situation.
    5. CONSULT Medical Direction where indicated APPROPRIATE transfer of care.

### Skin Burns
1. Soak in iced BENZALKONIUM CHLORIDE (ZEPHIRAN) 0.13% or wrap in soaked towels which are frequently re-wetted.
2. If hemodynamically stable, consider pain relief with narcotics.
3. Apply CALCIUM GLUCONATE 2.5% gel topically over burned area.

### Eye Injury
1. Saline flush for 3 minutes.
2. Apply topical TETRACAINE 1 - 2 drops for pain relief.
3. Flush with 1% CALCIUM GLUCONATE irrigation solution.
4. Consider use of Morgan Lens if available and trained.

### Inhalation Injury
1. Administer 100% Oxygen by NRB.
2. Administer 2.5% CALCIUM GLUCONATE continuously by nebulizer.

### Ingestion
1. Do NOT induce vomiting.
2. Dilute with water.
3. Administer Milk of Magnesia.

### Systemic Toxicity
1. In cases of suspected systemic toxicity:
   1. Administer 10% CALCIUM GLUCONATE 0.1 to 0.2 ml/kg, up to 10 ml IV.
   2. Administer MAGNESIUM SULFATE 1–2 grams IV.
   3. DIAGNOSTIC EKG PROCEDURE.
   4. Assure that receiving facility has access to 10% CALCIUM GLUCONATE.

## Indications
* Potential exposure with signs/symptoms consistent with hydrogen fluoride or hydrofluoric acid exposure.

## Signs and Symptoms
* Corrosive burns
* Erythema
* Excruciating pain
* Respiratory burns
* Pulmonary edema
* Cardiac dysrhythmia due to hypocalcemia
* Hypomagnesemia
* Seizures
* ST segment abnormalities
* Symptoms may take hours to present

## Differential Diagnosis
* Not specified in the protocol.

## Key Points
* Hydrofluoric acid can cause serious, painful burns of the skin. Specialized medical treatment is required.
* Burns larger than 25 square inches may result in serious systemic toxicity.
* Hydrofluoric acid is a highly corrosive acid which can severely burn skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Vapors can also burn other tissues.
* Assure that receiving facility has access to 10% CALCIUM GLUCONATE.

## Other Information
### Pathophysiology and Routes
* Gas or liquid can cause corrosive burns to skin and deep underlying tissue. Also binds to calcium and magnesium of nerve pathways, bone and bloodstream resulting in symptoms of depolarization producing excruciating pain and cardiac dysrhythmias.
* Routes: Inhalation, Skin Absorption, Ingestion.

### Sources and Uses
* Hydrogen Fluoride
* Hydrofluoric acid
* Industrial ceramic production
* Glass etching
