# Hyperthermia / Heat Exposure

## Overall Procedure
1. Universal Patient Care Protocol
2. Document Patient Temperature
3. Remove Patient from Heat Source
4. Remove Patient Clothing
5. Increase Air Flow around patient
6. Monitor and Reassess
7. Capnography Procedure
8. Cardiac Monitor / Diagnostic EKG Procedure
9. Blood Glucose Procedure
10. Transport to appropriate facility
11. Contact receiving facility
12. Consult Medical Control where indicated
13. Appropriate transfer of care

### Heat Exhaustion (NO AMS)
Criteria: No altered mental status (AMS).

1. Apply coldest water available or ICE water if possible
2. Apply ICE PACKS to Patient (Groin, Axilla, and Posterior neck)
3. Consider Cooling Collar
4. IV / IO Procedure:
    - If Hypotensive: IV Normal Saline Bolus 20 ml/kg
    - If Normotensive: IV Normal Saline TKO
    - Chilled Saline if available

### Heat Stroke (+AMS): Immersion Unavailable
Criteria: Altered mental status and cold water/ice immersion unavailable or cannot be prepared in 5 mins.

1. Apply coldest water available or ICE water if possible
2. Apply ICE PACKS to Patient (Groin, Axilla, and Posterior neck)
3. Consider Cooling Collar
4. IV / IO Procedure:
    - If Hypotensive: IV Normal Saline Bolus 20 ml/kg
    - If Normotensive: IV Normal Saline TKO
    - Chilled Saline if available

### Heat Stroke (+AMS): Immersion Available
Criteria: Altered mental status and cold water/ice immersion available or can be prepared in 5 mins (use any local assets/supplies).

1. Submerge as far up to neck as possible—keep head above water with towel or sheet under arms
2. Agitate the water
3. Keep immersed for 10–20 mins or return of normal mental status
    - OR until core temp < 102F (40C) if purpose made continuous core temp monitoring device available
    - If mental status fails to return to normal after 20 mins, look for other causes and/or contact Medical Control
4. Providers may use purpose made continuous core body temperature monitoring devices if already in place or provided. Regular spot check thermometers are insufficient. If unavailable, use mental status as the indicator to remove from cooling.
5. Do not interrupt submersion cooling for vomiting, bowel movement, combativeness, or seizures.
6. Transport with early notification to receiving hospital to begin preparing ice bath/cooling measures as needed
7. If immersion cooling has been initiated prior to EMS arrival by on scene providers, do not interrupt cooling for assessment or treatment until cooling period has completed per this protocol.
8. IV / IO Procedure:
    - IV Normal Saline Bolus 20 ml/kg
    - Chilled Saline if available

## Indications
* Exposure to increased temperatures and humidity
* Extreme exertion
* Heat Cramps
* Heat Exhaustion
* Heat Stroke

## Signs and Symptoms
* Fatigue and/or muscle cramping
* Altered mental status or unconsciousness
* Hot, dry, or sweaty skin
* Hypotension or shock
* Seizures
* Nausea
* Muscular / abdominal cramping
* General weakness
* Diaphoresis
* Febrile
* Confusion
* Dry mouth / thirsty
* Tachycardia
* BP normal or orthostatic hypotension
* Confusion
* Bizarre behavior
* Skin hot, dry, febrile
* Hypotensive
* Seizure
* Coma

## Differential Diagnosis
* Fever (infection)
* Dehydration
* Medications
* Hyperthyroidism (storm)
* Delirium tremens (DT's)
* Heat cramps
* Heat exhaustion
* Heat stroke
* CNS lesions or tumors
* Heat Exhaustion: Dehydration
* Heat Stroke: Cerebral Edema

## Key Points
* Exam: Mental Status, Skin, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Neuro
* Patients at risk for heat emergencies include neonates, infants, geriatric patients, and patients with mental illness. Other contributory factors may include heart medications, diuretics, cold medications, tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, anticholinergic medications, and alcohol.
* Cocaine, amphetamines, and salicylates may elevate body temperatures.
* Heat exposure can occur either due to increased environmental temperatures or prolonged exercise or a combination of both. Environments with temperature > 90°F and humidity > 60% present the most risk.
* Sweating generally disappears as body temperature rises
* Heat Cramps consists of benign muscle cramping 2° to dehydration and is not associated with an elevated temperature.
* Heat Exhaustion consists of dehydration, salt depletion, dizziness, fever, headache, cramping, nausea, and vomiting. Vital signs usually consist of tachycardia, hypotension, and an elevated temperature.
* Heat Stroke consists of dehydration, tachycardia, hypotension, elevated temperature, and altered mental status. Requires cooling.
* On scene cooling by submersion in ice water for heat stroke is imperative. Take time to prepare and submerge patient if suitable tub, ice, and water are available or can be set up in less than the transport time to the hospital or 5 mins. The hospital is unlikely to have immediate availability of an ice bath. Utilize available resources as soon as available to prevent patient deterioration.
* A body bag with ice and water can be used as a makeshift tub if necessary or during transport if additional cooling is required.
* Agitating the water will help with convection and cooling
* Shivering may occur as patient is cooled. Do not discontinue cooling until mental status or target core temperature is achieved.
* Heat stroke occurs when the cooling mechanism of the body (sweating) ceases due to temperature overload and/or electrolyte imbalances. Be alert for cardiac dysrhythmias for the patient with heat stroke.
* In patients with significant hyperthermia (temp > 104°F) begin actively cooling with natural or chemical ice packs applied to the patients’ groin, armpits (axilla), and back of neck if submersion is unavailable.
* Use best cooling options available prior to transport when feasible—cool patient before transport.

## Other Information
* Staying and getting core temp down is imperative.
