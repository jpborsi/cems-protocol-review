Review this EMS protocol according to the following three dimensions:
1. Clinical: Are the procedures, medications, and interventions effective and appropriate? Is the supplemental information accurate and complete?
2. Operational: Does the protocol adequately address expected operational concerns?
3. Wording: Are there any typos? Identify cases where the phrasing actively interferes with comprehension.

This protocol is one of many protocols available to providers in this system; assume that medication facts, procedure details, and other referenced protocols are complete and correct even if not included here.
Ignore capitalization. Generic drug names are valid in CamelCase, ALLCAPS, or tallMAN formats.
